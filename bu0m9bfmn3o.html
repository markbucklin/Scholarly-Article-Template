<div>The reversible assembly of the two parts composing the imaging system enabled repeated access to the underlying brain by detaching the optical window from the headplate. The feature provided flexibility on the time of cell transplantation or virus injection preferably days after craniotomy at which point the inflammatory response resulting from the procedure subsides and the brain clears from any bleeding that would otherwise obstruct the optical clarity during early imaging period. Trials of variable intervals between surgery and injection demonstrated flexible experimental timeline from a day to a week apart, but we advanced with two days due to a higher chance of bone regrowth with longer expansion between the two procedures. Accordingly, surgical procedures including headplate installation and craniotomy were performed two days prior to cell engraftment, -2 day-after-transplantation (DAT). On the day of transplantation, 0 DAT, two distinct sources of progenitor cells of which the integration characteristics have been well established were harvested from the cortex and the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence of E13.5 mouse embryos (REF). </div><div></div><div>Each progenitor cells from these regions are major sources of pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively, in the cortex. Subsequently, we used adeno-associated virus under a strong constitutive promoter, CAG, expressing GCaMP6f to uniformly label these multipotent stem cells to monitor their cellular activities throughout the course of maturation and integration. We first removed the seal covering the exposed brain from the craniotomy performed days in advance, then approximately 200,000 to 250,000 cells were transplanted in the neocortex of an adult recipient mouse preferably near the center of the imaging field and avoiding blood vessels to maximize the observable cells that migrate out from the injection site. The polymeric window was then installed parallel to the headplate ensuring complete seal between the two pieces to prevent infection and to maintain the physiological condition of the tissue while providing optical access to the underlying brain.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence microscopy was used to acquire the cellular dynamics across hundreds of cells at cellular- and subcellular-resolution during which the mouse was head-restrained and freely moving. Despite the low level of protein expression during earlier period of transduction, we were able to record the calcium activities of grafted cells within the first week of transplantation, generally 3 DAT. The imaging sessions were conducted three to four times a week in the course of the first month during which the progenitor cells migrate and differentiate into neurons and subsequently subsided into a weekly basis as the cells make physical and electrical connections and integrate into recipientâ€™s neural circuits (REF). The imaging system maintained its optical clarity over several months, in some cases lasting over 8 months. The extended period of clarity was achieved as the chemically-inert and biocompatible polymer window was recognized as part of the host system, and granulation tissue formed around the perimeter of the interface between the plug and the brain and prevented tissue growth over the brain which often challenges long-term imaging in the cortex using glass cranial window (REF). The simple procedure of window removal, however, allows access to the brain to perform durotomy or bone growth removal allowing extended imaging period with enhanced clarity as described in a previous work (Goldey et al., 2014).</div>
