The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year,     using the imaging system reported in Chapter 3. </div><div></div><div>We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.    </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.</div><div></div><div>the observation on this complex sequence of steps to complete integration&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> and facilitates a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. using wide-field imaging.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>         Utilizing  the system, we demonstrate a year-long course of wide-field imaging recording the  simultaneous activity in thousands of cortical neurons in awake mice. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>    The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. </div><div></div><div>Chronic imaging of&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;neural activity across  progenitor and local cell populations over an extended period will provide a  more complete picture of the integration process than previously available. We expected the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>First, I approached this problem by developing a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.</div>
