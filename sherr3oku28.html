Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity pattern during integration gathered from a year-long course of wide-field imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal.    </div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution.&nbsp;The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. To address this  concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation.</div><div></div><div>    Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neural activity of GECI-labeled transplants over the same region over several months, using a wide-field&nbsp;    epifluorescence  microscope. I performed periodic imaging procedure to track the development of grafted stem cells as the migrate through host cortex and functionally integrate with host neural networks.&nbsp;The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration.&nbsp;    Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding.&nbsp;We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.</div><div>how different sources have different courses</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="286720" class="ltx_title_section">Promise and challenges in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases</h1><div>Stem cells are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple specialized neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system.&nbsp;The therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage.
