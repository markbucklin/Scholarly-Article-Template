Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity pattern during integration gathered from a year-long course of wide-field imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal.    </div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution.&nbsp;The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. To address this  concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation.</div><div></div><div>    Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neural activity of GECI-labeled transplants over the same region over several months, using a wide-field&nbsp;    epifluorescence  microscope. I performed periodic imaging procedure to track the development of grafted stem cells as the migrate through host cortex and functionally integrate with host neural networks.&nbsp;The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration.&nbsp;    Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding.&nbsp;We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.</div><div></div><div></div><div>    </div><div>the observation on this complex sequence of steps to complete integration&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> and facilitates a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. using wide-field imaging.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="286720" class="ltx_title_section">Promise and challenges in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases</h1><div>Stem cells are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple specialized neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system.&nbsp;The therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage. Number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcome remain highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint what factors lead to failure or success. Meanwhile, snake oil industry (e.g. 'miracle' stem cell) offers high-hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this early stage of development      of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed mechanisms responsible for graft-induced effects often remains poorly validated. A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation are of crucial importance to resolve safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, currently, there is no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="391494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transplant of stem cells and follow-up assessment</h2><div>Successful engraftment of a transplant is measured by whether stem cell-derived neurons integrate with host neurons and functionally mature into physiologically active cells. The regenerative processes involve complex dynamics of cellular interactions, and donor cells must be able to survive, migrate to target sites, differentiate into specific neural phenotypes, and establish appropriate connectivity with host neural and synaptic networks. Conventional studies on the anatomical and the functional integration of transplanted cells commonly rely on immunohistochemical methods combined with rabies tracing and electron microscopy, and electrophysiological and optical recording, respectively. </div><div></div><div>Remarkably, grafted interneuron progenitor cells  have been reported to propagate from the original site, differentiate into  various mature interneurons, and integrate into neural circuits of the postnatal  and adult brains. After the transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice  electrophysiology have been performed on brain sections to quantify and  validate the survival, differentiation, migration, and integration of  MGE-derived interneurons. Previous studies in mice have reported that the  transplanted cells exhibit a survival rate of 20 % up to a year after  transplantation (Zipancic et al., 2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from the injection site in host cortical tissue,  and differentiate into mature interneurons with almost half of the population  expressing somatostatin and over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et  al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition, whole-cell recordings of the transplanted cells exhibited  electrophysiological properties of mature interneurons (Hunt et al., 2013), and  the inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC) showed significant increase in  frequency and amplitude on pyramidal neurons, indicating the direct synaptic  connections between the progenitor cells and the local cells (Zipancic et al.,  2010; Southwell et al., 2010).     </div><div></div><div>        Much of this assessments, however, heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal samples averaged from different cohorts of animals at distinct time points. Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and resource consuming. Thus, technical advances in the tools to track transplanted cells in vivo would be imperative to perform longitudinal studies and will shed light on the fate of transplanted cells over multiple spatial and temporal scales that is otherwise inaccessible from snapshots of events deduced from post-mortem tissue.&nbsp;</div><div></div><ul><li>electrophysiology: extracellular, patch-clamp, grid</li><li>fluorescence microscopy: slice, immuno-fluorescent probes/dyes, etc.</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="789092" class="ltx_title_subsection">Assessing stem cell function by continuous measurement of network activity</h2><div>Characteristics of spontaneous activity change progressively during cortical development. The early-form neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development through activity-developmental processes.&nbsp;The propagation patterns and frequencies of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation, differentiation, migration and connectivity. </div><div></div><div>Immature cells during development exhibit transient heightened state of plasticity, thus increasing excitability and mediating the influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors. The collective form of intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses, in addition to release of signaling molecules from these cells&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Previous studies&nbsp; have shown that neural stem cells form functional gap junctions with cells in&nbsp; organotypic culture as early as 2 – 18 hours after grafting. </div><div></div><div>Initially, the network activity is dominated by highly recurrent pattern of synchronous network activity, referred to as "network bursts". This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before the next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>During the early phase, synapse numbers significantly increase leading to massive overproduction of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The overproduction results in unstructured network connectivity which may explain the correlation of prolonged burst duration with increased synapse density. In the subsequent phase, this number declines with synaptic pruning to accommodate balance&nbsp; between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Both firing rate and burst duration decrease, and network bursts exhibits diversification of activity with richer patterns. Yet in isolated development, the characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns which normally extend only a few days in vivo, persist throughout the lifetime in cultured neurons that may suggest an arrest in development.&nbsp;Similar persistence of bursting was also observed in human organoid implant in mouse cortex.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>                                  The evolution of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate with host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit comparative developmental changes during maturation and integration and whether such developmental characteristics is important for integration remain to be determined. This feature may yield new biomarker for evaluating functional integration of transplanted stem cells in vivo.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="340468" class="ltx_title_section">New technology for optical imaging empowers researchers with chronic in vivo observation capability</h1><div>                                  Technical advances  in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. Such technique can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and visualization of interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution, and this modality has become relatively affordable and widely available. Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Just this past year, two more studies pursued&nbsp; similar experimental approaches to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In addition to structural imaging, functional imaging strategies can be applied to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds. Consequently, the scale of these studies were limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells (N &lt; 1~2). Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2>Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h2><div>       Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those preciously available in science-grade cameras. Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last decade, this combination of developments have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which have undoubtedly strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>Scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable of recording continuous activity of greater than one thousand neurons in a behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional epifluorescence microscopy. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may provide better insights into neural coding.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="593217" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse neocortex</h1><h2 data-label="954772" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the key  advantages of in vivo imaging regards the ability to observe and record from  the same brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes.  This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="719479" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Long-term Continuous imaging study to follow grafted stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger multicellular networks in vivo has now become both practical and possible. Using the imaging techniques described above, individual cells can be followed throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of viability, distribution, differentiation as well as cellular and network activity from each animal. The dynamic sequence of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells can be tracked across days using a high-resolution volume scanning procedure with a two-photon microscopy. Additionally, wide-field imaging techniques have been proven effective to study the brain by monitoring neural activity within multicellular network at high temporal and spatial resolution and measuring their response to variable conditions of external environment.&nbsp;<span>New types of measurements may emerge from the experimental approaches and may offer a better reflection of timing and extent at which transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural networks.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div>The  process leading to functional integration of grafted interneurons with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks; however the complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. Chronic imaging of&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;neural activity across  progenitor and local cell populations over an extended period will provide a  more complete picture of the integration process than previously available. Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding related to motor activity. We expected the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons.    &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Optical imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed. Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue. The ability to identify which elements of their particular  host environment are the factors driving success or disruptive factors leading  to failure will be essential towards successful integration for stem cell  therapy.&nbsp;However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large scale, and the development of such experimental platform will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can feedback towards the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                  </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div><h2>Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies.
