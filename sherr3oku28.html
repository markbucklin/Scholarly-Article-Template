Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity pattern during integration gathered from a year-long course of wide-field imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal.    </div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution.&nbsp;The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. To address this  concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation.</div><div></div><div>    Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neural activity of GECI-labeled transplants over the same region over several months, using a wide-field&nbsp;    epifluorescence  microscope. I performed periodic imaging procedure to track the development of grafted stem cells as the migrate through host cortex and functionally integrate with host neural networks.&nbsp;The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration.&nbsp;    Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding.&nbsp;We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.</div><div>how different sources have different courses</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></b></div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="106298" class="ltx_title_section">Promise and challenges in stem cell  therapy for neurological diseases</h1><div>Stem cells  are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into  multiple specialized neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or  damaged neurons in the central nervous system.&nbsp;<a>The therapeutic potential of stem cells  holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems in  neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage. </a>A number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies for strokes  and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic  relief in patients. Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcomes remain  highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint which factors lead to  failure or success. Meanwhile, the snake oil industry that purports ‘miracle’  stem cells offers high hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this early  stage of development of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed mechanisms  responsible for graft-induced effects often remain poorly validated. A better  understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to  transplantation are of crucial importance to ensure the safety and efficacy of  stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, there is currently no  easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental  process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any  attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="876057" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell  research</h1><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="735242" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transplant of stem cells and follow-up assessment</h2><div>Successful  engraftment of a transplant is measured by whether stem cell-derived neurons  integrate with host neurons and functionally mature into physiologically active  cells. The regenerative processes involve complex dynamics of cellular  interactions, and donor cells must be able to survive, migrate to target sites,  differentiate into specific neural phenotypes, and establish appropriate  connectivity with host neural and synaptic networks. Conventional studies on  the anatomical and the functional integration of transplanted cells commonly  rely on immunohistochemical methods combined with rabies tracing and electron  microscopy, and electrophysiological and optical recording, respectively. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Remarkably,  grafted interneuron progenitor cells have been reported to propagate from the  original site, differentiate into various mature interneurons, and integrate  into neural circuits of the postnatal and adult brains. After the  transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology have been  performed on brain sections to quantify and validate the survival,  differentiation, migration, and integration of MGE-derived interneurons.  Previous studies in mice have reported that the transplanted cells exhibit a  survival rate of 20 % up to a year after transplantation (Zipancic et al.,  2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from  the injection site in host cortical tissue, and differentiate into mature  interneurons with almost half of the population expressing somatostatin and  over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition, whole-cell recordings of the  transplanted cells exhibited electrophysiological properties of mature  interneurons (Hunt et al., 2013), and the inhibitory postsynaptic currents  (IPSC) showed significant increase in frequency and amplitude on pyramidal  neurons, indicating the direct synaptic connections between the progenitor  cells and the local cells (Zipancic et al., 2010; Southwell et al., 2010). </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Much of these  assessments, however, heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal  samples averaged from different cohorts of animals at distinct time points.  Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and  resource consuming. Thus, technical advances in the tools to track transplanted  cells in vivo will be imperative to perform longitudinal studies and will shed  light on the fate of transplanted cells over multiple spatial and temporal  scales which is otherwise inaccessible from snapshots of events deduced from  post-mortem tissue.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="467974" class="ltx_title_subsection">Assessing stem cell function by continuous measurement of  network activity</h2><div>Characteristics  of spontaneous activity change progressively during cortical development. Early-form  neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development  through activity-developmental processes.&nbsp;The propagation patterns and frequencies  of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation,  differentiation, migration and connectivity. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Initially,  the network activity is dominated by a highly recurrent pattern of synchronous  network activity referred to as“network bursts.” This short burst is 0.5 - 2  seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases  of a silent network recovery and a low-level activity before the next  initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into  more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with  better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Immature  cells during development exhibit transient heightened state of plasticity, thus  increasing excitability and mediating the influx of calcium through  voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors. The collective form of  intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as  an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses, in addition to  release of signaling molecules from these cells (Malmersjo et al., 2013;  Jaderstad et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells  form functional gap junctions with cells in organotypic culture as early as 2 –  18 hours after grafting. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>During the  early phase, synapse numbers significantly increase leading to massive  overproduction of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The overproduction results  in unstructured network connectivity, which may explain the correlation of  prolonged burst duration with increased synapse density. In the subsequent  phase, this number declines with synaptic pruning to accommodate the balance&nbsp;between  excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Both firing rate and burst duration  decrease, and network bursts exhibit diversification of activity with richer  patterns. Yet in isolated development, the characteristic synchronized burst  activity patterns that normally extend only a few days in vivo persist  throughout the lifetime in cultured neurons, which may suggest an arrest in  development.&nbsp;Similar persistence of bursting was also observed in human  organoid implant in mouse cortex.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The evolution  of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed  using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using  multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular  calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity  in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed  synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate  with a host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit  comparative developmental changes during maturation and integration and whether  such developmental characteristics are important for integration remain to be  determined. This feature may yield a new biomarker for evaluating functional integration  of transplanted stem cells in vivo.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="612980" class="ltx_title_section">New technology for optical imaging  empowers researchers with chronic in vivo observation capability</h1><div>Technical  advances in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular  processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural  networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used  for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as  Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins.  This also includes optical imaging modalities such as confocal microscopy,  multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>High-resolution  volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging  with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. This technique  can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and  subcellular resolutions anstd visualization of interactions between cells in  their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also helps to visualize  anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution,  and this modality has become relatively affordable and widely available. Falkner  et al. were first to report the use of the technique to track the regenerative  processes of transplanted stem cells. Just this past year, two more studies by  Real et al. and Mansour et al. &nbsp;pursued&nbsp;similar  experimental approaches to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration  and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition  to structural imaging, functional imaging strategies can be applied to monitor  neural activity, which should allow for a more integrative assessment of  graft-to-host connectivity. &nbsp;In the studies  referred to above, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for  functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in  anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate  cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of  view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal  resolution on a time scale of milliseconds. Consequently, the scale of these  studies was limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells (N  &lt; 1~2). Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute  long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging  modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><ul><li></li></ul>
