Number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcome remain highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint what factors lead to failure or success. Meanwhile, snake oil industry (e.g. 'miracle' stem cell) offers high-hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this early stage of development      of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed mechanisms responsible for graft-induced effects often remains poorly validated. A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation are of crucial importance to resolve safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, currently, there is no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="480719" class="ltx_title_subsection">Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div>
