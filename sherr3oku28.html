Given the structural and functional complexity of the brain and its multiplicity of phenotypes, the challenge to induce functional recovery through cell replacement may seem daunting. Nevertheless, diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease and epilepsy that are characterized by a selective loss of neuronal phenotypes have been proven to be amenable to the therapeutic approach in animal models. Moreover, clinical trials of cell replacement with grafts of fetal tissues have provided evidence to induce sustained behavior improvements, and more clinical opportunities are underway with the progress in generating neurons and glial cells from stem cells in culture. While neuronal replacement involves complex dynamics of cellular interactions over weeks to establish connections with host neural circuits, the regenerative process remains largely unknown. And much of our knowledge on the molecular, morphological and electrophysiological properties of grafted cells is primarily derived from discrete time points of post-mortem analyses. In order to develop stem cell-based therapeutics that would lead to functional restoration in the brain, the technical ability for continuous observation with high temporal and spatial resolution would be important for comprehensive understanding of the biological processes.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="480719" class="ltx_title_subsection">Embryonic development of cortical neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what they are capable of and what they require if cultured or transplanted (survival, migration, differentiation, connectivity)</li><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) and isolated development (in-vitro)... </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity is affected (and is measured)</li></ul><div>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</div><h3 data-label="469859" class="ltx_title_subsubsection"></h3><h2 data-label="890168" class="ltx_title_subsection">Embryonic neural progenitor cell transplant</h2><div>Transplants can be tracked using a variety of methods, including periodic electrophysiology, ex-vivo imaging of tracer, immunohistochemistry and ...</div>
