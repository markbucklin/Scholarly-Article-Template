Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process.&nbsp;In this thesis proposal, I outline an  experimental platform which I am developing to enable optical imaging of stem  cells and facilitate a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. </div>
