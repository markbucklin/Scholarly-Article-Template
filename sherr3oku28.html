Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution. To address this  concern, we report the design of a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation. Utilizing  the system, we demonstrate a year-long course of wide-field imaging recording the  simultaneous activity in thousands of cortical neurons in awake mice. </div>
