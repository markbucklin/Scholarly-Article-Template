Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity pattern during integration gathered from a year-long course of wide-field imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal.    </div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution.&nbsp;The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. To address this  concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation.</div><div></div><div>    Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neural activity of GECI-labeled transplants over the same region over several months, using a wide-field&nbsp;    epifluorescence  microscope. I performed periodic imaging procedure to track the development of grafted stem cells as the migrate through host cortex and functionally integrate with host neural networks.&nbsp;The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration.&nbsp;    Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding.&nbsp;We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.</div><div>how different sources have different courses</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="286720" class="ltx_title_section">Promise and challenges in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases</h1><div>        Stem cells  are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into  multiple specialized neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or  damaged neurons in the central nervous system.&nbsp;<a>The therapeutic potential of stem cells  holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems in  neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage.&nbsp;</a>A number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies for strokes  and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic  relief in patients. Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcomes remain  highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint which factors lead to  failure or success. Meanwhile, the snake oil industry that purports 'miracle' stem cells offers high hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this  early stage of development of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed  mechanisms responsible for graft-induced effects often remain poorly validated.  A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to  transplantation are of crucial importance to ensure the safety and efficacy of  stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, there is currently no  easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental  process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any  attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div>    </div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="391494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transplant of stem cells and follow-up assessment</h2><div>Successful  engraftment of a transplant is measured by whether stem cell-derived neurons  integrate with host neurons and functionally mature into physiologically active  cells. The regenerative processes involve complex dynamics of cellular  interactions, and donor cells must be able to survive, migrate to target sites,  differentiate into specific neural phenotypes, and establish appropriate  connectivity with host neural and synaptic networks. Conventional studies on  the anatomical and the functional integration of transplanted cells commonly  rely on immunohistochemical methods combined with rabies tracing and electron  microscopy, and electrophysiological and optical recording, respectively. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Remarkably,  grafted interneuron progenitor cells have been reported to propagate from the  original site, differentiate into various mature interneurons, and integrate  into neural circuits of the postnatal and adult brains. After the  transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology have been  performed on brain sections to quantify and validate the survival,  differentiation, migration, and integration of MGE-derived interneurons.  Previous studies in mice have reported that the transplanted cells exhibit a  survival rate of 20 % up to a year after transplantation (Zipancic et al.,  2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from  the injection site in host cortical tissue, and differentiate into mature  interneurons with almost half of the population expressing somatostatin and  over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition, whole-cell recordings of the  transplanted cells exhibited electrophysiological properties of mature  interneurons (Hunt et al., 2013), and the inhibitory postsynaptic currents  (IPSC) showed significant increase in frequency and amplitude on pyramidal  neurons, indicating the direct synaptic connections between the progenitor  cells and the local cells (Zipancic et al., 2010; Southwell et al., 2010). </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Much of these  assessments, however, heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal  samples averaged from different cohorts of animals at distinct time points.  Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and  resource consuming. Thus, technical advances in the tools to track transplanted  cells in vivo will be imperative to perform longitudinal studies and will shed  light on the fate of transplanted cells over multiple spatial and temporal  scaleswhich is otherwise inaccessible from snapshots of events deduced from  post-mortem tissue.&nbsp;</div>
