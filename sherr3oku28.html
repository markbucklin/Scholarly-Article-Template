Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process.&nbsp;In this dissertation, I outline an  experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and facilitates a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>First, I apprdeveloped  a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.</div>
