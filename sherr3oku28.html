Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process.&nbsp;In this dissertation, I outline an  experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and facilitates a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>    The  process leading to functional integration of grafted stem cells with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks; however the complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. Chronic imaging of&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;neural activity across  progenitor and local cell populations over an extended period will provide a  more complete picture of the integration process than previously available. Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding related to motor activity. We expected the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons.    &nbsp;    </div><div></div><div></div><div>First, I approached this problem by developing a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.</div>
