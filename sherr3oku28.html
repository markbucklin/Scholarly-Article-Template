Preliminary clinical trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients.</li><li>Nevertheless, the therapeutic strategies are still at an early stage of development, and a better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation would be critical to realize clinical translation.&nbsp;</li><li>However, there is currently no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process.&nbsp;Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and resource consuming.</li></ul><div></div>
