Nevertheless, diseases such as Parkinsonâ€™s disease and epilepsy that are characterized by a selective loss of neuronal phenotypes have been proven to be amenable to the therapeutic approach in animal models. Moreover, clinical trials of cell replacement with grafts of fetal tissues have provided evidence to induce sustained behavior improvements, and more clinical opportunities are underway with the progress in generating neurons and glial cells from stem cells in culture. While neuronal replacement involves complex dynamics of cellular interactions over weeks to establish connections with host neural circuits, the regenerative process remains largely unknown. And much of our knowledge on the molecular, morphological and electrophysiological properties of grafted cells is primarily derived from discrete time points of post-mortem analyses. In order to develop stem cell-based therapeutics that would lead to functional restoration in the brain, the technical ability for continuous observation with high temporal and spatial resolution would be important for comprehensive understanding of the biological processes.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="480719" class="ltx_title_subsection">Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div></div><h2>Transplant of stem cells and follow-up assessment</h2><div></div><ul><li>how the success of a transplant is measured, i.e. whether they integrate with host brain cells and function as brain cells should (<b>survive, migrate, differentiate, connect</b>)</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>measure activity (functional)</li><li>morphological (anatomical)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>electrophysiology: extracellular, patch-clamp, grid</li><li>fluorescence microscopy: slice, immuno-fluorescent probes/dyes, etc.</li></ul><ul><li>either way, they are both SNAPSHOT assessment -&gt; sacrifice animal (laborious, inefficient)</li><li></li><li>what they are capable of and what they require if cultured or transplanted (survival, migration, differentiation, connectivity)</li></ul><div></div><h2 data-label="789092" class="ltx_title_subsection">Assessing stem-cell function by continuous measurement of network activity</h2><ul><li>Progression of characteristic spontaneous activity: </li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>predictable synchronous bursts -&gt; unpredictable asynchronous&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) and isolated development (in-vitro)... </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity</li></ul><ul><li>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</li></ul><div>Transplants can be tracked using a variety of methods, including periodic electrophysiology, ex-vivo imaging of tracer, immunohistochemistry and ...</div>
