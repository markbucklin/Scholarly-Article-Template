<div></div><div></div><div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in  living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various  labeling strategies and imaging modalities. For instance, the dynamic sequence  of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells have been  followed over extended period using magnetic resonance imaging in animals and  humans.         </div><div>                                  A recent report demonstrated longitudinal observation  of the dynamics of morphological integration and synaptic reinnervation of  grafted stem cells using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. The technique  provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and  functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and  microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method  is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the  population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. </div><div></div><div>Other  fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but  their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent  proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of  regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence  of events.         </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="488593" class="ltx_title_section">Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h1><div>Optical recording of neural activity has become increasingly popular in the last few years owing to evolving digital imaging technology, and the development of increasingly effective functional indicators such as the generically encoded fluorescent calcium sensor, GCaMP6f.&nbsp;Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope with a scientific-CMOS  camera, we can record the intracellular calcium transients in hundreds of distinct neurons across wide  areas of the brain of awake behaving mice. Additionally, when  combined with pharmacological and optical manipulation and/or electrophysiological  recording, optical imaging provides a sophisticated approach to investigate  neuronal function within the larger neural network.&nbsp;    As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment.   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells.</div>
