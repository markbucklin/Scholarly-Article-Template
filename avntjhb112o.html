Prototypes  were fabricated using CamBam to generate toolpaths in G-code for machining on a  CNC mill. The headplate and window frame were milled from aluminum plate. The  mold for casting PDMS-based windows was designed in <a>three parts</a><a href="#_msocom_1">[SC1]</a>&nbsp;. The middle component was milled from PTFE. <a>The outer components were made using a  laser-cutter and acrylic sheet (Supplementary). </a><a href="#_msocom_2">[SC2]</a>&nbsp;CAD files are shared on XXXXX(github?)XXXXX. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="162333" class="ltx_title_section"> Window casting procedure</h1><div>The PDMS-based windows were fabricated through vacuum casting  procedure. Prior to casting, window frames and two glass coverslips (Corning,  2947-75x38), prepared in advance through plasma etching (30 sec, Power setting) and  silanization using Trichlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich, 448931-10G), were inserted into  the mold. The mold was then placed between two custom-made acrylic plates with  silicone gaskets in between and was assembled using bolts around the <a>perimeter</a><a href="#_msocom_3">[SC3]</a>&nbsp;. The pressure control port (McMaster-Carr, 5454K61) was connected to  the house vacuum line, and the fill port (McMaster-Carr, 2844K11) was connected  to uncured PDMS polymer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) (1:10 by weight), thoroughly  mixed and degassed in advance. The liquid-state polymer was then drawn into the  mold filling the volume in between the two coverslips using vacuum. Once  polymer displaced all air, vacuum was released and positive pressure was  applied through the pressure control port after plugging the fill port. While  maintaining positive pressure, the polymer was cured at 75ºC for 12 hours.  Finally, the windows were released from the mold and trimmed using scalpels.  Windows were handled so as to protect the top and bottom surfaces from damage  or debris. The completed window was sterilized in an autoclave before use. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="994187" class="ltx_title_section">Experiment timeline</h1><div>The experimental timeline was referenced to the day of cell transplantation, 0 day-after-transplantation (DAT). Surgeries were performed two days in advance, and imaging sessions started from 5 DAT until the optical clarity lasted, in some cases extending upto 250 DAT.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="138646" class="ltx_title_section"> Surgical procedures</h1><div>Animal care for surgical procedures is  described below, and the details specific to each procedure are in the sections  that follow. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and  Use at Boston University. Stereotaxic surgeries were performed on 6 to 8 weeks  old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories). Pre-operative care for  the initial headplate and craniotomy procedure included subcutaneous  administration of meloxicam (NSAID, 2.5 ug/g) and buprenorphine (opioid  analgesics, 0.3 ug/g), and intramuscular injection of dexamethasone  (corticosteroid, 5 ug/g) one hour before surgery. Meloxicam and buprenorphine  were continued postoperatively every 12 hours for 48 hours. Meloxicam was also  given before and after procedures where brain tissue was exposed, i.e. those  for <a>intracerebral</a><a href="#_msocom_4">[SC4]</a>&nbsp;<a href="#_msocom_5">[SC5]</a>&nbsp; injection and window replacement. For all procedures described below,  mice were placed under general anesthesia with isoflurane mixed with oxygen.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="720017" class="ltx_title_section"> Headplate installation and  craniotomy</h1><div>We shaved the top of the mouse’s head and sterilized the skin using 70%  alcohol and 7.5% Betadine. We made a 1cm midline sagittal incision through the  scalp using surgical scissors, and retracted laterally using a self-retaining  retractor (WPI, 501968). To prepare the cranial surface, we applied 3% hydrogen  peroxide to oxidize and facilitate removal of periosteal tissue with cotton tip  swabs. The surface was then marked up before headplate installation followed by  craniotomy. We targeted laterally symmetric craniotomies with edge length 2.2  mm centered at coordinates ±1.83 mm lateral to sagittal suture and 1.00 mm  anterior to bregma. First, we used a surgical skin marker (FST, 18000-30) to  roughly indicate the site of each craniotomy and enhance contrast of the edges  to be etched. We etched the corners and edges using a dental drill with a FG  1/4 round carbide burr (Fig. 2 Step 1(L)). This way of marking the edges  facilitates headplate placement and also aids recovery of the intended  craniotomy position despite being covered by semi-transparent adhesive cement  in the following steps.</div><div>We used a custom stereotaxic attachment (Supplementary) to position the headplate  symmetrically aligned with the marked sites, and to hold it horizontal while  bonding to skull. The headplate was anchored directly to the skull using either  opaque or semi-clear quick adhesive cement (Parkell, S380). Subsequently, we  began each craniotomy by drilling along the marked edges (Fig. 2 Step 2(L)). We  frequently stopped to flush debris from the site using sterile saline and an  aspirator. Once separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was  carefully removed using a pair of sharp forceps (FST, 91150-20) and a 45º micro  probe (FST, 10066-15) while keeping the dura intact (Fig. 2 Step 1(R)). At this  point, we either attached the optical window or sealed the area with a layer of  non-toxic silicone adhesive (WPI, KWIK-SIL). </div><div></div><h1 data-label="139073" class="ltx_title_section"> Optical insert attachment</h1><div>The optical insert attachment can be performed immediately following  the craniotomy or deferred to the day of injection as described below (Fig. 2  Step 4). First, we filled the headplate chamber with sterile 0.5% agarose  solution, immersing the exposed brain. Enough agarose was added so as to  overflow the walls of the chamber as the window is inserted, ensuring no air  gaps remain in the space between the walls of the chamber and the window, below  the joint to be sealed. Next, the window was placed in the chamber, directly  over the craniotomy, in gentle contact with the exposed tissue. We used a ttaxic  apparatus to adjust the window height and secure its position during  attachment. This was aided by an attachment – similar to that used for  headplate installation – which fixed the angle of the window’s top surface  parallel with that of the headplate. The height adjustment required depressing  the window until full contact was observed between the inner window surface and  the dura. The window was tacked in place by applying an accelerated light-cured  composite (Pentron Clinic, Flow-It ALC) in at least three points, bonding the  window frame to the anterior and posterior walls of the headplate. At this  point the guide was removed and the joint was prepped for sealing. Excess  agarose (polymerized overflow from the window insertion step) was aspirated  away to expose and clean the headplate surface surrounding the window. The  chamber was sealed by filling the joint between headplate and optical insert  with dental cement (Stoelting, 51458) using a P200 pipette. The window surface  was protected by applying a double layer adhesive strip made of gaffers tape  over a transparent adhesive film dressing (3M: Tegaderm, 70200749201).</div><div></div><h1 data-label="669050" class="ltx_title_section"> Window detachment and replacement</h1><div>The dental cement<a> </a><a href="#_msocom_6">[SC6]</a>&nbsp;connecting the window and headplate was etched away using a dental  drill. Before removing the window, we thoroughly flushed debris from the  surrounding surfaces with sterile saline. <a>Replacement windows were installed using the  same procedures described above for initial attachment. Localizing the  replacement window to the same position was aided by the expansion of  granulation tissue up to the walls of the prior window.</a><a href="#_msocom_7">[SC7]</a>&nbsp; </div><div></div><h1 data-label="110068" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-font-green" data-font-color="true">Animal surgery, virus injection, and stem cell transplantation</span></h1><div>All surgical procedures followed the Boston University IACUC protocol. Surgeries are performed on 6 to 8 weeks old female C57/BL6 mice as the recipients for progenitor cell transplantation. One hour prior to the surgery, dexamethasone (5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary, 07-808-8194) was administered by intramuscular injection to relieve any tissue inflammatory response and to prevent cerebral edema. The mouse was placed under general anesthesia with 1 - 1.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. As pre-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-845-6986) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-891-9756) were administered subcutaneously (SC) to reduce pain and inflammatory responses. The mouse was immobilized on a stereotaxic. The incision area was sterilized using 70% alcohol and XX, then a cut was made along the midline of the brain. The skin was retracted apart laterally using surgical clamps (XX), and 3% H2O2 was applied to remove the periosteum of the skull. Four corners of a square craniotomy over motor cortex with edges of 2.2 mm and center coordinates of 1.83 lateral and 1.00 anterior was lightly etched using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. The etched points were marked over with surgical skin marker (XX), then the edges were etched along the four corners using a dental drill. The marking procedure was necessary to enhance the contrast of the etched areas for accurate placement of the headplate under the semi-transparent dental cement in the step to follow. Utilizing a custom made surgical guide fixed onto the stereotaxic that will hold the headplate horizontal to the plane, the headplate was positioned roughly over the centers between the intended craniotomy regions of both hemispheres and anchored directly onto the skull using C&amp;B Metabond. Once the Metabond hardened, the surgical guide was removed and the excess bone cement covering the etched area was drilled away. Once the skull was exposed, it was cleaned of any debris by irrigating with sterile saline. Subsequently, 2.2 x 2.2 mm2 craniotomy was performed on one or both sides of the hemisphere along the previously marked area using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. Constant flow of sterile saline and and aspirator was used to cool down the brain and to flush out any debris. Once the skull within the craniotomy was separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was carefully removed using a pair of XX forceps (XX) and a Bonn microprobe (XX) while keeping the dura intact without any damage. Sterile saline was used to further clean up the area, and the exposed brain area was sealed using KwikSil (XX). The mouse was then moved for recovery, and for post-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, SC) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, SC) were administered over 48 hour period to reduce inflammation and pain. </div><div>Prior to injection or cell transplantation, the KwikSil plug covering over the craniotomy was carefully removed from the edges to avoid any capillary rupture below the dura due to the negative pressure created by the seal. The brain was flushed several times with sterile saline before and after the injection procedure. Injections were performed using glass pipettes with an outer tip diameter of 40 – 80 um on Nanofil controlled by MicroXX. The pipette was back-filled with mineral oil then front-loaded with virus or cells. In general, an injection of 230 nL of cells at 10^6 cells/uL or 200 nL of virus (titer) was performed ~ 500 um into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min on each hemisphere. The micropipette was let to sit additional 2 min at the injection site to prevent any overflowing then was withdrawn slowly. </div><div>Once the injection was completed, sterile 0.5% agarose was used to fill in any air gaps over the exposed brain tissue, and the polymer-based window was placed directly on top of the dura over the craniotomy. Using a custom made guide, the window was held parallel to the headplate and pushed down to compensate for the removed skull thickness. Once the height was adjusted, UV curable dental cement (XX) was used to quickly fix the window in place on the headplate. The guide was moved out of the way, and any agarose that overflow from the window insertion was aspirated out once it polymerized. Dental cement (XX) was then used to seal the rest of the junction between the headplate and the window ensuring air tight seal between the two parts. Gaffers tape on top of wound sealing tape (XX) was used to protect the polymer window from any scratches. Meloxicam (2.5 ug/g) was given every 24 hours over the next 72 hours to reduce any inflammation due to the installation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="623659" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-font-green" data-font-color="true">Progenitor cell harvest and labeling </span></h1><div>The progenitor cells from cortex and ganglionic eminence were both harvested from E13.5 CD-1 mouse embryos (Charles River). The detailed dissection procedures can be found in prior papers (REF). Briefly, the two hemispheres were separated from the brain stem. The cortical progenitor cells were collected from the dorsal and lateral regions of the cerebral cortex. Then, the interneuron progenitor cells from medial and lateral ganglionic eminence were dissected from the basal forebrain in which the sulcus separating the tissue is evident. Once the tissues were dissected, the tissue chunks were let to sit in the dissociation medium, 100 ug/mL of DNaseI in DMEM, at 37 for 10 min, and subsequently mechanical dissociated by gently pipetting up and down using a P200 pipette. The dissociated cells were let to sit another 2 min, and the supernatant was transferred and spun at 270 g for 10 min. The medium was removed as much as possible, and the cell pellet was dissociated in 50 uL of NB/B27 medium and 2 uL of AAV9-Cag-GCaMP6f (titer) was added to the medium. During the 30 mins of incubation period at 37 °C for transduction, the cell suspension was pipetted gently every 10 min to keep the cells dissociated. Following the transduction, three washing steps were performed to remove any excess virus in the supernatant. First, 7 mL of DMEM was added to the mixture of cells and virus then centrifuged at 270 g for 10 min. Once the pellet was formed, the medium was removed and the previous step was repeated twice more. The cell pellet was then washed with 1 mL of DMEM then was resuspended at the concentration of 10^6 cells/ uL in NB/B27 and kept in ice until transplantation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="726204" class="ltx_title_section"> Injection</h1><div><a href="#_msocom_8">[SC8]</a>&nbsp;The exposed brain was flushed with sterile saline before and after each  injection. Injections were made using pulled glass micropipettes with inner tip  diameter ranging from 40 and 80 um (WPI, 504949). The micropipette was  initially back-filled with mineral oil, then secured onto a microprocessor  controlled injector (WPI, NANOLITER2010). The micropipette was then  front-loaded with virus or cells using a controller (WPI, Sys-Micro4). In  general, an injection of 230 nL of cells labeled with AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6f  (AV-9-PV3081, Penn Vector Core) at 106 cells/uL, or 230 nL of  AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV2822, Penn Vector Core). Injection was performed  approximately 500 um deep into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min near the  center of the imaging field, while avoiding blood vessels to maximize the  observable cells around the injection site (Fig. 2 Step 3). The micropipette  was left to sit for an additional 2 min at the injection site before slow  withdrawal. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="391757" class="ltx_title_section"> Wide-field in vivo imaging and  microscope setup</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was  accomplished using a custom microscope equipped with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu,  ORCA Flash 4.0XX), 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3), excitation and emission  filters of XX and XX, a dichroic mirror (XX), and a 10x objective lens  (Mitutoyo, 378-803-3). Mice were positioned under the microscope for imaging  using a custom headplate holder (Supplementary) and allowed to run on an air-supported spherical  treadmill18 as pictured in Figure 2 Step 5. The camera recorded a field-of-view of  approximately 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm using an image resolution of 2048 x 2048 or more  commonly 1024 x 1024. Continuous image sequences were acquired at 40 to 60 frames-per-second  for 5 to 7 minutes. We selected the field to image within each site by roughly  centering around the injection site. To focus the microscope on labeled cells  in the superficial layers of cortex, we focused on the surface vasculature to  find a stable reference, then advanced the focal plane 50 to 150 <a>um until  multiple cells were distinguishable</a><a href="#_msocom_9">[SC9]</a>&nbsp;. A reference image of the selected image was recorded for each site  and used later to reacquire the same field across image sessions. Alignment to  this reference image relied primarily on using the major blood vessels as  landmarks to guide microscope position in the XY plane. Image sequences were  stored for subsequent processing and analysis.</div><div></div><h1>Immunohistochemistry</h1><div>Brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde by perfusion, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound then sectioned coronally at 40 um using a Cryostat. Free-floating sections were immune-stained with chicken anti-GFP (1:250) and rabbit anti-GABA (1:1000). Confocal images were taken using scanning confocal microscope in Micro/Nano Imaging Facility in the Biomedical Engineering department.    </div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 3: Cranial window</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="728874" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution. </div><div></div><div>Efforts to overcome  this problem by adding purely mechanical features to the cranial window have  involved attaching spacers made of agarose11,17, silicone18,19  and glass7 to the window’s brain-facing surface that compensate for  the thickness of removed bone. These approaches report delaying tissue regrowth  for up to a few months before optical quality deteriorates. These modest  results indicate a valid basis underlying this approach and suggest that  extending this strategy by starting with a design and material not limited by the  fixed form of flat glass optical windows could yield some improvement.  Additional elements of a chronic cranial imaging window intended to mitigate  degradation by granulation tissue typically target inflammation, the primary  source stimulating the process. These include the aseptic design of seals and  features, selective use of biocompatible materials, and perioperative  administration of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs7,20,21.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>While these designs  have improved longevity, they remain limited in terms of long-term access to  the cortical tissue. The ability to access and manipulate tissue during  real-time imaging opens the door in experimental designs to an expansive  toolbox of neuromanipulation possibilities allowing exploration of uncharted  connectivity and dynamic processes of the brain22. Several  strategies have been reported to gain access to regions below glass cranial  windows by incorporating features such as an access port sealed with elastomer23,  infusion cannula24, or the use of microfluidic channels17.  Nonetheless, the approaches limit the tissue accessibility to a single  designated site predetermined before an experiment begins and do not offer  uniform access over the imaging area.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To address the  relative restrictions using glass as cranial windows, a number of alternative  approaches have highlighted the use of silicone elastomer for cranial windows25–29. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)  is optically clear, non-toxic and chemically inert and can be molded to take  any shape or exhibit any desired feature, not necessarily sacrificing the  imaging field of the window. These properties combine to offer a remarkably  versatile material, particularly favorable for prototype development for  projects with demanding specifications for biocompatibility and optical  performance. A well-known and widely used example is the artificial dura for in  vivo optical imaging in nonhuman primates25,26,30. This chronic implant device is placed in  and covers a craniotomy and sits protected within a chronic cranial recording  chamber. It mitigates tissue regrowth, and interfaces with a cylindrical insert  – also made of PDMS – for optical imaging of neocortex. Additionally, the  artificial dura is thin enough to enable access to underlying tissue for  penetrating electrodes, which penetrate easily and leave a tight seal after  withdrawal. Yet the efforts for translating this design windows for small  research animals using silicone elastomer have thus far been limited (ref). And  a system with long-lasting optical quality and flexible tissue accessibility  remains to be developed or explored for rodent models. </div><div></div><div>In this chapter, Ie  describe a design and demonstrate a two-stage cranial implant device, developed  to facilitate longitudinal imaging experiments in mouse neocortex.

Additionally, the  two-part system consisting of a fixed headplate with integrated neural access  chamber and optical insert, allowed flexible access to the underlying tissue.  The utility of our design is demonstrated through chronic optical imaging of  calcium dynamics in the cortex and acute interventions to the tissue upon  removal and replacement of the cranial window from the headplate. Finally, I demonstrate the technical feasibility  of rapid adaptation of the system that can accommodate varying applications,  further extending our ability to visualize and access neural tissue.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div></div><h1 data-label="728874" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>Here we report the design for a head-fixation and cranial  window device, and the procedures for surgical attachment. The sections below  describe the features of each component, and also report the critical elements  that contribute to the performance and capabilities of our cranial implant  device. The following sections provide a detailed report of the system  performance observed during evaluation. The final section reports the  adaptability of the system with the demonstration of the latest design.</div><h2></h2><h2 data-label="777676" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cranial  Window System       &nbsp;</h2><div>Many design features, and procedures for installation were  introduced and developed to mitigate tissue growth for the sustained optical  quality of the window. Other features were included to enhance imaging  performance in awake behaving animals, to facilitate repeatable localization of  image fields across sessions and animal subjects.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The cranial implant device is composed of two parts: a  headplate with an integrated chamber, and an optical insert. The headplate is  bonded to the dorsal surface of the animal’s skull. The optical insert --  sometimes referred to as a “cranial window” -- seals the chamber and establishes  an optical interface with the animal’s brain through craniotomy sites in the  chamber floor (Fig 1a). </div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="138739" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Headplate</h3><div>The bottom surface of the headplate is curved to conform to  the dorsal skull surface of a typical mouse. This feature aids alignment during  attachment, and a large surface area enables a strong adhesive bond to the  skull surface. Adhesive cement is applied continuously along all points of  contact to create a permanent bond along the entire perimeter of both sides of  the chamber. The cement applied along this joint effectively seals the bottom  of the aseptic chamber and is critical for its long-term integrity.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The wide area of skull-to-headplate attachment provides a  mechanically stable coupling between the animal’s skull and the headplate holder,  which is fixed to the microscope table. The headplate is bonded to all skull  plates, which stiffens the skull tremendously. Additional rigidity is provided  by a central support structure that contacts the skull along the sagittal  suture. All these features combine to provide a very rigid attachment to the  mouse cranium, which drastically reduces its motion relative to the imaging  system (Fig 1b). Remaining brain motion is then primarily movement relative to  the skull, and may originate from physiological forces (i.e. cardiorespiratory)  as much as behavioral forces from animal movement; suppressing this  intracranial motion is addressed in the design of the optical insert described  below.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="762057" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Chamber</h3><div>The chamber in the headplate center facilitates intermittent  physical access to neural tissue by protecting the craniotomy sites between tissue  interventions. Once the headplate is bonded to the animal’s skull, the floor of  the chamber is formed by the central support structure that traverses and fuses  the sagittal suture, the skull surface surrounding each craniotomy, and a flat  ledge that extends laterally. The joints between the skull surface edges of the  central support, anterior and posterior walls, and the lateral ledge are sealed  during the headplate attachment procedure. This bottom seal is crucial for  maintaining an aseptic environment for the protection of the exposed brain  tissue. When the dura mater is left intact during the craniotomy, the space  within the chamber is continuous with the epidural space. </div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="297584" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Optical Insert</h3><div>The insert has optically flat top and bottom rectangular  surfaces. The bottom brain-facing surfaces are positioned to form a flat  interface with the intact dura through each craniotomy. The body of the insert  provides a clear optical light-path between top and bottom surfaces. The walls  of the body are tapered to increase the angle of unimpeded light  collection/delivery at the image field. This increases the numerical aperture  for imaging through high power lenses, and also expands options for off-axis  illumination. The tapered body is extended to the brain surface via  vertical-walled columns that traverse each craniotomy. These columns fill the  space made by removal of the bone flap during craniotomy, and their bottom  surface gently flattens the brain tissue, positioning the cortex in a  horizontal plane for convenient wide-field imaging. Both the top and bottom  surfaces are made optically clear by integrating microscope slides in the mold  when casting. The dimensions of the insert are depicted in figure 1-b.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Inserts are fabricated in batches using an optically  transparent silicone elastomer. We vacuum cast the part in a PTFE and glass  mold with an aluminum window frame inclusion that gets embedded near the upper  surface. This frame provides a site for attachment and sealing to the rim of  the chamber, as well as structural reinforcement. This helps to establish and  maintain a flat optical surface at the top of the insert, parallel to the  headplate (Fig 1b). We constructed inserts with the bottom surface parallel to  the top, which works well for imaging medial cortical regions. For imaging  lateral cortical regions (e.g. visual or auditory cortex) the mold can be  adapted to produce inserts that form a flat image plane with consistent controllable  angle relative to the headplate. For any desired angle, this capability greatly  simplifies recording from a consistent image plane across sessions and animals.  The medial cortical region imaged in the demonstration provided here was square  in shape (2 mm X 2 mm), at a horizontal angle of 0 degrees, and extended from  0.83 mm to 2.83 mm symmetrically off the midline (Fig 1a). </div><div> </div><h2 data-label="488500" class="ltx_title_subsection">Installation and Usage</h2><div>The surgical installation procedures for this two-stage cranial  implant device were adapted from a combination of procedures in common use for  attachment of headplates and cranial windows in mice, and similar devices used  for optical imaging in primates. The specific protocol evolved during 3  distinct trial runs, and the final protocol is summarized here and detailed in  methods and materials below. The 18 mice reported here received the same  version of headplate and optical insert. Minor changes were made to the  surgical procedures from one batch to the next, each with discernable effect;  see the discussion for details. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Because this is a two-stage cranial implant device, the  procedure for installation can be separated into multiple distinct surgeries  depending on experimental requirements. The first stage includes headplate  attachment to bare skull, centrally aligned along the AP axis with the  bilateral sites over the cortical region of interest. Once the headplate is  securely bonded, bilateral craniotomy can be made through the skull in the floor  of the chamber. If the second stage of installation is performed separately,  the chamber is given a temporary silicone seal to protect the craniotomy. We  delayed the second stage of installation for at least 2 to 3 days to allow for  mouse recovery.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The second stage involves installation of the optical insert,  and may be directly preceded by injection of virus, pharmaceutical compounds,  exogenous cells, or any other substance of interest. The cranial window is  installed in the chamber with the assistance of a custom stereotaxic attachment,  which enables fine height adjustment and holds the window’s position while  being secured in place. The angle of the window’s top surface is held parallel  with that of the headplate. The chamber is partially filled with sterile  agarose to displace all air from the chamber when the optical insert is lowered  into place. The height is adjusted to provide full contact between the insert’s  bottom surface and the dura, which also places the insert’s frame in close  proximity to the rim of the chamber. Dental cement is applied to form a joint  between the headplate and the window frame of the optical insert, installing  the insert in place and aseptically sealing the chamber. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The optical insert can be removed and replaced at any time  to provide intermittent physical access to the neural tissue and/or for window  replacement (i.e. for mid-experiment injections or window damage repair,  respectively). Removal is relatively easy, accomplished by etching away the  joint between headplate and optical insert. Window replacement uses the same  procedure as the second stage installation described above. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The replacement procedure was attempted 5 times, 4 of which  were successful in preserving or restoring optical quality to “like-new”  condition, without inflicting detectable tissue damage. Three windows were  removed and replaced following damage to the top surface of the optical insert,  inflicted by feisty cage-mates with sharp incisors (at 91, 83, and 172 days  post-installation; 91 days case unsuccessful). The remaining two cranial  windows were removed at 20 days post-installation to facilitate direct tissue  access for grafting exogenous cells to the imaged region. We found that the  removal needs to be performed slowly, taking great care to avoid capillary  rupture in the exposed brain and surrounding granulation tissue. During each of  these procedures, we observed the pattern of granulation tissue growth into the  peripheral area of the chambers. Photos of the typical growth (as observable  with window removed) at day 172 is shown in figure 3-d, and described in more  detail below.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="128230" class="ltx_title_subsection">Evaluation of System Performance</h2><div>Throughout development we installed several prototypes to  test the effect of various features and conditions. The cranial window design  and surgical procedures described in this paper were attempted with 18 mice.  Cranial window condition was evaluated by direct observation and evaluation of  fluorescence dynamics in processed video recorded during periodic 5-minute  imaging sessions. Direct (bright-field) observation with a stereoscopic  microscope was useful for evaluating quality of the optical interface with  brain tissue, as well as for tracking progression of granulation tissue growth  in the surrounding space at the edges of the craniotomy. Analysis of cell  dynamics measures from processed fluorescence imaging video indicated actual  usability of the window for longitudinal studies requiring activity metrics at  a cellular level.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="369571" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Experimental Batches</h3><div>The first batch served as a short trial-run for the  prototype and procedures whose performance in early tests suggested strong  potential for long-term reliability. We ran the first batch for 4-6 weeks to  get a better assessment of what we could expect for long-term viability. With  this design and minor modifications to the surgical procedure, we felt  comfortable using the window in longitudinal studies with significant  investment of time and resources at stake that would also allow for continuous  assessment of the window’s optical performance in parallel. The first batch (N  = 7) of windows was installed and was evaluated 2-3 times/week for just over 1  month. Several more were installed for use in a long-term imaging study  beginning with the second batch (N = 6), then the last batch (N = 5). The  results of these runs are reported below, summarized in figure 3-b. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="988739" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sustained Optical Quality Extended over a Year</h3><div>In the first batch of 7 mice, optical quality provided by  the window was more than sufficient to record cell dynamics across both image  regions beginning 4 days post-installation and fluorophore-transfection  procedure and was sustained for several weeks. At 4-6 weeks post-installation  this batch of mice was evaluated and 6 of the 7 mice were discontinued and the  installation procedure was adjusted for the next batch. The decision to  discontinue in each case was based on observed deterioration in either the  health of the mouse (4 out of the 6) or the optical quality of the window (2  out of the 6). See the discussion section for the mechanisms we suspected to  underlay and procedural adjustments made to address these issues.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We continued to observe and image the 7th mouse. Progression of the optical quality and fluorophore  expression characteristics in bilateral image regions is depicted in figure 4  for this mouse. Optical quality at the brain-to-window interface has remained  consistent for longer than 18 months. The structure of granulation tissue  surrounding the window at 12 months is described in detail below and depicted  for this mouse in figure 3-d. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similar to the first batch, the second batch of 6 mice was  observed and recorded for some time (3-5 months) before discontinuing all  except one most exceptional mouse. This mouse received a window replacement at  day 83, and was imaged periodically for 11 months before terminating due to a  health concern unrelated to the surgical procedure.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The imaging period for the last batch was extended without  pre-termination to more thoroughly test the longer-term limits of sustained  optical quality. Of 5 mice, 1 mouse did not recover as promptly as expected  following the craniotomy procedure and was immediately discontinued. We  observed consistent performance on long-term optical quality, extending over 12  months on average among the 8 windows. Half of these windows remain to be  imaged to this day, and the rest were discontinued either followed by capillary  rupture within image field or the deterioration of the health of the aged  animals. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="210757" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Direct Observation of the Integrated Chamber</h3><div>We periodically examined the imaging chamber condition in  all implanted mice using a stereoscopic microscope. Degradation of the optical  interface was found frequently in prototypes/procedures that preceded the one  mentioned here. This was observed as progressive extension of a cloudy white  inhomogeneous layer across the brain-facing surface of the optical insert.  Using the design and procedures reported in this paper, this type of  degradation rarely occurred, limited to the cases reported above in Batch 1.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Remarkably, but not unexpectedly, tissue growth surrounding  the insert was evident in all cases, regardless of window quality. The tissue  appeared highly vascularized, and grew from the craniotomy edge outward along  the chamber floor (figure 3-c). This growth is a natural response to the tissue  damage inflicted by any craniotomy procedure. The difference observed here is  only that the growth does not extend under the window. Instead, it forms a  non-adhesive interface with the vertical-walled columns and diverges upward  into the aseptic chamber, replacing the agarose fill between the optical insert  and the adhesive cement covering the skull and chamber floor. To further  investigate the structure of granulation tissue growth into the peripheral  chamber areas we removed the optical insert for unobstructed observation in  several mice. An especially gnarly example from a 6-month duration window is  pictured in figure 3-d. </div><div> </div><h2 data-label="101053" class="ltx_title_subsection">Adaptability</h2><div>We also report here an adaptation of the more thoroughly-tested  headplate and cranial window design described above. The most obvious  difference in the newer design is a substantially larger window, which provides  optical access to the entire dorsal cortex. Additional features were added to  aid window positioning, improve sealing performance, and to simplify  fabrication. Adding the additional design features was made possible by  switching the headplate fabrication process from CNC machining to 3D printing,  as discussed below. Following is a summary of the major changes incorporated in  the latest configuration, included here to demonstrate the adaptability of the  basic design described above.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The height and width of the window frame and chamber were  increased, and the window thickness decreased. Protrusions were added to the  bottom surface of the headplate which follow the lateral edges of the chamber.  These protrusions contact the mouse cranium along the squamosal suture to  maintain a rigid skull-to-headplate attachment despite a reduction in  attachment area and removal of a larger fraction of parietal and frontal bone.  A thin skirt was added to the bottom surface of the optical insert along its  perimeter to help block tissue growth across the imaging area. This is  analogous to the vertical-walled column of the prior design, which compensated  for the skull thickness, but it accommodates the irregular curves of the  endocranium surrounding the larger window. Window installation and height  adjustment are improved by fixing small nuts into the headplate on either side  of the chamber, and using fine-threaded screws to fasten the optical insert in  place. This method of window installation provides a vast improvement over the  dental cement method used with the prior design and facilitates fine  adjustments to the window height. A thin coat of silicone was added to the  chamber's inner walls prior to installation to help seal the upper rim of the  chamber with the outer edge of the optical insert. The tape that was used  previously to protect the top surface of the implant was replaced with a solid  flat magnetically-coupled cap.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="887459" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>The two-stage cranial implant devices described here were developed  to enable reliable long-term optical access and intermittent physical access to  mouse neocortex. Our particular application required bilateral cortical windows  compatible with wide-field imaging through a fluorescence microscope, and  physical access to the underlying tissue for virus-mediated gene delivery and  injection of exogenous labeled cells. Optical access was required as soon as  possible post-installation, and to be sustained for several months. The design  focused on addressing the issue common to other window designs meant for  rodents: progressive degradation of the optical light-path at the  brain-to-window interface caused by highly scattering tissue growth. The optical  insert is molded to fit the chamber and craniotomy, blocking tissue growth and  providing a reliable optical interface for up to one year. Additionally, the  core design can be rapidly adapted to improve performance or for varying  applications.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="626472" class="ltx_title_subsection">Critical Elements</h2><div>In assessing the design presented here, we can point to a  few critical elements that facilitate the maintenance of the long-term optical  quality. Refer to the methods section for the specifics of surgical procedures  for headplate attachment and optical insert installation. These procedures were  established after testing the variable formulations in protocol.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>First, the design of the optical insert must incorporate a  mechanical barrier that fits along the edges of the craniotomy. The barrier  must be continuous along the circumference, and extend as far as the inside  surface of the skull to be effective.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Achieving this tight fit without aggressively impinging on  the brain requires some sort of fine height adjustment capability. The optical insert  must be installed at the correct height during the installation procedure, or  shortly thereafter. The insert must be depressed very slightly until full  contact is made across the entire window, but pressing beyond necessary will  quickly exert an undesired increase in intracranial pressure, increasing  inflammation and adverse outcomes. The mechanism for fine adjustment can be  designed into the system, as is demonstrated in the second design presented  here, or incorporated into the installation procedure, as is done in the first  design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Of particular note, we found that administration of  antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in the days surrounding any major  surgical procedure had a substantial impact on the viability of the optical  interface. We used both corticosteroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, and attempts to exclude either ended poorly more often than not (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Equally critical to the long-term health of the imaging  chamber was the requirement to establish and maintain an air-tight seal between  the chamber and the outside world. This includes a permanent bond between the  chamber and skull, and a reversible bond between the chamber rim and optical  insert. How this is accomplished will be specific to the system design, but it  is absolutely essential.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition to establishing and maintaining an air-tight  seal, it is necessary to eliminate any and all pockets of air within the  chamber. Any air pockets that remain after installation will be susceptible to  bacteria growth and may disrupt normal intracranial and intermembrane  pressures. The system presented here used sterile agarose fill to displace all  air within the chamber prior to sealing. Dead space surrounding the optical insert,  including that temporarily filled with agarose, will fill with fluid and  eventually be overtaken by granulation tissue. This process is helpful to the  maintenance of a aseptic chamber environment, so care should be taken not to  disrupt it. However, an excess of dead space will delay this process, and thus  should be minimized when adapting the design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Many attempts to test variations from the described  procedures indicated that all elements mentioned above are equally critical to  achieving a reliable imaging window with sustained optical quality.  Implementing the procedures as described or something similar should mitigate  the primary obstacle to long-term imaging in mice and other rodents. The need  to pre-terminate imaging experiments due to optical light-path disruption by  tissue ingrowth should be substantially reduced. This capability will  drastically reduce wasted time and resources for experiments of any duration,  and will facilitate previously infeasible studies requiring long-term  observation such as for research in aging or the progression chronic neurological  disorders.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="651583" class="ltx_title_subsection">Staging Implant Installation &amp; Tissue Access</h2><div>Configuring the implant as described, so as to enable a  staged installation of multiple parts enables surgical procedures to be spread  across multiple days. This capability offers a number of advantages. It may  save time and resources -- particularly during the prototype stages -- by  allowing time to ensure each implanted mouse fully recovers from the initial  procedure. Additionally, the delay between surgeries allows the heightened  inflammation and other immune system response triggered by craniotomy to  normalize before attempting a tissue intervention that is sensitive to these  conditions (e.g. viral or cell injections) (ref). Through this mechanism the  system offers the capability to image the first tissue intervention from day 0.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similarly, designing the system to be installable in  multiple stages enables trivial and repeatable tissue access at later time  points by simple reversal of procedure for optical insert installation. The  process may be comparable to a previously reported method of removing the  entire glass window to access the tissue (ref). With this system, however, the  methods used to remove and replace are faster and simpler and carry less risk  of tissue damage compared. Additionally, the described methods of facilitating  tissue access can be advantageous over a fixed access port by providing full  access without compromising the image field (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="415096" class="ltx_title_subsection">Design Adaptation</h2><div>While the specific designs described in this report have  much to offer, the greatest asset of the underlying system is its easy  adaptability. The design can be rapidly transformed to accommodate various  applications or to modify its performance in response to new technologies and  demands. This rapid adaptability was a primary goal of this project, and  informed our design and engineering decisions throughout development. Anyone  with access to common laboratory equipment and moderate engineering and  fabrication skills can produce a system to fit their particular needs. As an inherent  aspect of any design process, the adaptation of the original design evolved  over the course of prototyping and testing. In presenting two designs in this  report, our intention was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of  continuous development of a future-proof system. The original system was  adapted to accommodate the continuous evolution of image sensor technology,  particularly the growth in size and resolution, expanding the field of view and  allowing simultaneous access to cellular interactions across multiple brain  regions using wide-field imaging (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The iterative process used here was only made possible by  using the now widely available rapid prototyping procedures, 3D-printing and  laser-cutting -- major progress of manufacturing and its increased versatility,  providing better quality, customization, lower cost and shorter production time  (ref). In an effort to compare various manufacturing technologies, we explored  manufacturing the finalized product design through a number of companies and  advanced with 3D metal printing with overall satisfaction at i.materialise --  we had also developed the parts through other rapid prototyping companies  including Shapeways and Sculpteo.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="322223" class="ltx_title_subsection">Future Improvements</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="147941" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conclusion</h2><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 4: Stem cell imaging</span></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 5: Conclusion</span></b></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[SC1]</a>Plus silicone  gaskets??</div><div>And tube connectors?? </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/8”  tube connectors?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_2">[SC2]</a>Further  description of mold design and fabrication needed.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_3">[SC3]</a>Go with the description</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_4">[SC4]</a>Intracortical?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_5">[SC5]</a>intracranial?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_6">[SC6]</a>sealing the chamber and</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_7">[SC7]</a>xue, does this  make sense now?
