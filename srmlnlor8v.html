<div>The progenitor cells from cortex and ganglionic eminence were both harvested from E13.5 CD-1 mouse embryos (Charles River). The detailed dissection procedures can be found in prior papers (REF). Briefly, the two hemispheres were separated from the brain stem. The cortical progenitor cells were collected from the dorsal and lateral regions of the cerebral cortex. Then, the interneuron progenitor cells from medial and lateral ganglionic eminence were dissected from the basal forebrain in which the sulcus separating the tissue is evident. Once the tissues were dissected, the tissue chunks were let to sit in the dissociation medium, 100 ug/mL of DNaseI in DMEM, at 37 for 10 min, and subsequently mechanical dissociated by gently pipetting up and down using a P200 pipette. The dissociated cells were let to sit another 2 min, and the supernatant was transferred and spun at 270 g for 10 min. The medium was removed as much as possible, and the cell pellet was dissociated in 50 uL of NB/B27 medium and 2 uL of AAV9-Cag-GCaMP6f (titer) was added to the medium. During the 30 mins of incubation period at 37 Â°C for transduction, the cell suspension was pipetted gently every 10 min to keep the cells dissociated. Following the transduction, three washing steps were performed to remove any excess virus in the supernatant. First, 7 mL of DMEM was added to the mixture of cells and virus then centrifuged at 270 g for 10 min. Once the pellet was formed, the medium was removed and the previous step was repeated twice more. The cell pellet was then washed with 1 mL of DMEM then was resuspended at the concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ uL in NB/B27 and kept in ice until transplantation.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="726204" class="ltx_title_section"> Injection</h1><div><a href="#_msocom_8">[SC8]</a>&nbsp;The exposed brain was flushed with sterile saline before and after each  injection. Injections were made using pulled glass micropipettes with inner tip  diameter ranging from 40 and 80 um (WPI, 504949). The micropipette was  initially back-filled with mineral oil, then secured onto a microprocessor  controlled injector (WPI, NANOLITER2010). The micropipette was then  front-loaded with virus or cells using a controller (WPI, Sys-Micro4). In  general, an injection of 230 nL of cells labeled with AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6f  (AV-9-PV3081, Penn Vector Core) at 106 cells/uL, or 230 nL of  AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV2822, Penn Vector Core). Injection was performed  approximately 500 um deep into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min near the  center of the imaging field, while avoiding blood vessels to maximize the  observable cells around the injection site (Fig. 2 Step 3). The micropipette  was left to sit for an additional 2 min at the injection site before slow  withdrawal. </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="391757" class="ltx_title_section"> Wide-field in vivo imaging and  microscope setup</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was  accomplished using a custom microscope equipped with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu,  ORCA Flash 4.0XX), 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3), excitation and emission  filters of XX and XX, a dichroic mirror (XX), and a 10x objective lens  (Mitutoyo, 378-803-3). Mice were positioned under the microscope for imaging  using a custom headplate holder (Supplementary) and allowed to run on an air-supported spherical  treadmill18 as pictured in Figure 2 Step 5. The camera recorded a field-of-view of  approximately 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm using an image resolution of 2048 x 2048 or more  commonly 1024 x 1024. Continuous image sequences were acquired at 40 to 60 frames-per-second  for 5 to 7 minutes. We selected the field to image within each site by roughly  centering around the injection site. To focus the microscope on labeled cells  in the superficial layers of cortex, we focused on the surface vasculature to  find a stable reference, then advanced the focal plane 50 to 150 <a>um until  multiple cells were distinguishable</a><a href="#_msocom_9">[SC9]</a>&nbsp;. A reference image of the selected image was recorded for each site  and used later to reacquire the same field across image sessions. Alignment to  this reference image relied primarily on using the major blood vessels as  landmarks to guide microscope position in the XY plane. Image sequences were  stored for subsequent processing and analysis.</div><div></div><div></div><h1>Immunohistochemistry</h1><div>Brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde by perfusion, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound then sectioned coronally at 40 um using a Cryostat. Free-floating sections were immune-stained with chicken anti-GFP (1:250) and rabbit anti-GABA (1:1000). Confocal images were taken using scanning confocal microscope in Micro/Nano Imaging Facility in the Biomedical Engineering department.    </div><div></div><div></div>
