<div>The progenitor cells from cortex and ganglionic eminence were both harvested from E13.5 CD-1 mouse embryos (Charles River). The detailed dissection procedures can be found in prior papers (REF). Briefly, the two hemispheres were separated from the brain stem. The cortical progenitor cells were collected from the dorsal and lateral regions of the cerebral cortex. Then, the interneuron progenitor cells from medial and lateral ganglionic eminence were dissected from the basal forebrain in which the sulcus separating the tissue is evident. Once the tissues were dissected, the tissue chunks were let to sit in the dissociation medium, 100 ug/mL of DNaseI in DMEM, at 37 for 10 min, and subsequently mechanical dissociated by gently pipetting up and down using a P200 pipette. The dissociated cells were let to sit another 2 min, and the supernatant was transferred and spun at 270 g for 10 min. The medium was removed as much as possible, and the cell pellet was dissociated in 50 uL of NB/B27 medium and 2 uL of AAV9-Cag-GCaMP6f (titer) was added to the medium. During the 30 mins of incubation period at 37 Â°C for transduction, the cell suspension was pipetted gently every 10 min to keep the cells dissociated. Following the transduction, three washing steps were performed to remove any excess virus in the supernatant. First, 7 mL of DMEM was added to the mixture of cells and virus then centrifuged at 270 g for 10 min. Once the pellet was formed, the medium was removed and the previous step was repeated twice more. The cell pellet was then washed with 1 mL of DMEM then was resuspended at the concentration of 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ uL in NB/B27 and kept in ice until transplantation.</div><div></div>
