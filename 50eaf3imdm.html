<div>The therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation  to replace lost and damaged cells in neurological diseases has been proven promising in  several clinical studies. Neural replacement involves complex dynamics of cellular interactions over weeks to establish connection with host neural networks. Although evidence has revealed some detail regarding  the cellular mechanisms underlying cell survival and integration after  transplantation, much of our knowledge on the molecular, morphological and electrophysiological properties of grafted cells is primarily derived from discrete time points of post-mortem analyses. Ideally, to understand the  developmental process of grafted stem cells, such as the cellular and neural  networks influencing the functional integration of stem cells, one should track  the same cells throughout the integration process in the living brain.&nbsp;</div><div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various labeling strategies and imaging modalities.&nbsp;Recording neural activity using optical technique has been performed for many years but has become increasingly popular recently owing to the technical advancement of larger, faster, and more sensitive imaging sensors combined with new generations of GECI that can report neural activity with extremely high fidelity.     By labeling stem cells with GECI, the  imaging technique will allow a more thorough assessment of the functional  connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain, whereas electrophysiology is  restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or two target regions.     </div><div>Glass  cranial windows have been widely adopted for cortical imaging, however, the  system permits limited access to the tissue for further manipulation after the  initial implantation. For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal. </div><div>In order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells.</div><div>In this chapter, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year,     using the imaging system reported in Chapter 3. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.</div>
