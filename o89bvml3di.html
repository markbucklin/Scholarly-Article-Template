Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcomes remain  highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint which factors lead to  failure or success. Meanwhile, the snake oil industry that purports 'miracle' stem cells offers high hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this  early stage of development of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed  mechanisms responsible for graft-induced effects often remain poorly validated.  A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to  transplantation are of crucial importance to ensure the safety and efficacy of  stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, there is currently no  easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental  process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any  attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div>    </div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="391494" class="ltx_title_subsection">Transplant of stem cells and follow-up assessment</h2><div>Successful  engraftment of a transplant is measured by whether stem cell-derived neurons  integrate with host neurons and functionally mature into physiologically active  cells. The regenerative processes involve complex dynamics of cellular  interactions, and donor cells must be able to survive, migrate to target sites,  differentiate into specific neural phenotypes, and establish appropriate  connectivity with host neural and synaptic networks. Conventional studies on  the anatomical and the functional integration of transplanted cells commonly  rely on immunohistochemical methods combined with rabies tracing and electron  microscopy, and electrophysiological and optical recording, respectively. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Remarkably,  grafted interneuron progenitor cells have been reported to propagate from the  original site, differentiate into various mature interneurons, and integrate  into neural circuits of the postnatal and adult brains. After the  transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology have been  performed on brain sections to quantify and validate the survival,  differentiation, migration, and integration of MGE-derived interneurons.  Previous studies in mice have reported that the transplanted cells exhibit a  survival rate of 20 % up to a year after transplantation (Zipancic et al.,  2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from  the injection site in host cortical tissue, and differentiate into mature  interneurons with almost half of the population expressing somatostatin and  over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition, whole-cell recordings of the  transplanted cells exhibited electrophysiological properties of mature  interneurons (Hunt et al., 2013), and the inhibitory postsynaptic currents  (IPSC) showed significant increase in frequency and amplitude on pyramidal  neurons, indicating the direct synaptic connections between the progenitor  cells and the local cells (Zipancic et al., 2010; Southwell et al., 2010). </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Much of these  assessments, however, heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal  samples averaged from different cohorts of animals at distinct time points.  Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and  resource consuming. Thus, technical advances in the tools to track transplanted  cells in vivo will be imperative to perform longitudinal studies and will shed  light on the fate of transplanted cells over multiple spatial and temporal  scales which is otherwise inaccessible from snapshots of events deduced from  post-mortem tissue.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>electrophysiology: extracellular, patch-clamp, grid</li><li>fluorescence microscopy: slice, immuno-fluorescent probes/dyes, etc.</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div>                                  </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div><h2>Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div><div>The integration and the therapeutic implication of grafted MGE  derived-neurons have been widely recognized over the past decade (Alvarez-Dolado  et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2014; Sebe et al., 2014).        &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="151132" class="ltx_title_section">Summary of introduction</h1><ol><li>Stem cells could do amazing things when transplanted into adults, but their challenging to work with</li><li>Other people have tried things to assess the success of their development attempts -&gt; very arduous</li><li>functional fluorescent probes like Gcamp make continous assessment possible</li><li>would work with mice, but simple cranial window approaches are insufficient for the required timeline (optical quality does not persist long enough, is unreliable, restricts phsyical access, and has initial waiting period), SO....</li><li>Chapter 3 I describe a window that meets these requirements and performance exceeds expectations</li><li>Chapter 4 I describe two proof of concept studies that use the above-mentioned device to facilitate long-term continuous imaging of calcium dynamics in two types of stem cells implanted into mouse cortex.

The ability to perform chronic imaging over the same  region will allow the migration of these cells to be traced along with any  changes in cellular activities over the maturation and integration period, with  spatio-temporal resolution.</div><div> </div><div>The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process</div>
