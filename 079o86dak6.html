<div>In this chapter, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process, but the use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications to reveal novel aspects of the process that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.</div><div></div><div> </div><div>In this section, I propose to integrate  the transplantation procedure of MGE cells with the imaging system developed in  the previous section to monitor the functional integration of the grafted cells  using chronic imaging over the same area. By labeling stem cells with GECI, the  imaging technique will allow a more thorough assessment of the functional  connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain, whereas electrophysiology is  restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or two target regions. The utility of the platform will be tested by  performing periodic structural and dynamic imaging procedures to track the  development of grafted stem cells as they migrate through host cortex and  functionally integrate with host neural network. Migration of cells and changes  in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning procedure  with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across sessions. Additionally,  continual imaging over a region will give us the ability to track the stem  cells along with their change in cellular activities upon transplantation in which  temporal and spatial information is simultaneously acquired. I will also record  the running behavior of the mice utilizing a ball treadmill on which the mouse  can run freely during the imaging sessions. Additionally, we can use  information theory to produce measurements of neural activity as it relates to  behavior. Specifically, mutual information (i.e. cross-correlation) between  network activity and behavior (movement) can be calculated in which the measure  indicates the functional integration of cells in the host neural network  presumably responsible for corresponding behavior. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="683539" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div><div>Previous  studies report that transplanted interneuron progenitor cells retain their  ability to migrate long distances, survive and mature into interneurons, and  integrate into the host neural circuitry. Thus, interneuron progenitor cells,  MGE cells, were selected as the cell source for transplantation for my studies.  I initially assessed stem cell survival under the chamber described in Aim 1 by  injecting GFP labeled stem cells and collecting sections at 3, 7, 14, and 42  DAT. Immunohistology revealed that grafted cells survived and migrated away  from the injection site, presented neuronal morphology at two weeks, and  differentiated into GABAergic interneurons at six weeks after transplantation. Assessing  the chronic stability of the optical window required recording cellular  activity over a long period: cortical and MGE cells were labeled with the GECI  GCaMP6f and imaged during mouse behavior. Fluorescence intensity was recorded using  a wide-field epifluorescence microscope while the head-fixed mouse was moving  on a spherical treadmill. Dynamic cellular activity was observed in both host  cortical neurons and transplanted MGE cells in several sessions recorded up to  43 DAT upon transplantation. Following the acquisition, imaging data are  processed using an automated procedure to segment cells and extract  fluorescence intensity signals over time. Fluctuations in these signals  indicate activation dynamics in dozens of individual MGE-derived neurons. Further  analysis will be directed toward quantification of correlated activity between  cells, cell networks, and mouse behavior. I expect the behavior related to neural  activity in newly grafted cells will be spontaneous and uncorrelated, but that  correlation increases as grafted cells integrate into the host neural network  and participate in behavior functions.</div>
