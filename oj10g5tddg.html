Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding related to motor activity. We expected the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>First, I approached this problem by developing a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.</div>
