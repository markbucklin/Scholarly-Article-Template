Prototypes  were fabricated using CamBam to generate toolpaths in G-code for machining on a  CNC mill. The headplate and window frame were milled from aluminum plate. The  mold for casting PDMS-based windows was designed in <a>three parts</a><a href="#_msocom_1">[SC1]</a>&nbsp;. The middle component was milled from PTFE. <a>The outer components were made using a  laser-cutter and acrylic sheet (Supplementary). </a><a href="#_msocom_2">[SC2]</a>&nbsp;CAD files are shared on XXXXX(github?)XXXXX. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="605758" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Window casting procedure</h2><div>The PDMS-based windows were fabricated through vacuum casting  procedure. Prior to casting, window frames and two glass coverslips (Corning,  2947-75x38), prepared in advance through plasma etching (30 sec, Power setting) and  silanization using Trichlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich, 448931-10G), were inserted into  the mold. The mold was then placed between two custom-made acrylic plates with  silicone gaskets in between and was assembled using bolts around the <a>perimeter</a><a href="#_msocom_3">[SC3]</a>&nbsp;. The pressure control port (McMaster-Carr, 5454K61) was connected to  the house vacuum line, and the fill port (McMaster-Carr, 2844K11) was connected  to uncured PDMS polymer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) (1:10 by weight), thoroughly  mixed and degassed in advance. The liquid-state polymer was then drawn into the  mold filling the volume in between the two coverslips using vacuum. Once  polymer displaced all air, vacuum was released and positive pressure was  applied through the pressure control port after plugging the fill port. While  maintaining positive pressure, the polymer was cured at 75ºC for 12 hours.  Finally, the windows were released from the mold and trimmed using scalpels.  Windows were handled so as to protect the top and bottom surfaces from damage  or debris. The completed window was sterilized in an autoclave before use. </div><div></div><h2 data-label="447740" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Surgical procedures</h2><div>Animal care for surgical procedures is  described below, and the details specific to each procedure are in the sections  that follow. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and  Use at Boston University. Stereotaxic surgeries were performed on 6 to 8 weeks  old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories). Pre-operative care for  the initial headplate and craniotomy procedure included subcutaneous  administration of meloxicam (NSAID, 2.5 ug/g) and buprenorphine (opioid  analgesics, 0.3 ug/g), and intramuscular injection of dexamethasone  (corticosteroid, 5 ug/g) one hour before surgery. Meloxicam and buprenorphine  were continued postoperatively every 12 hours for 48 hours. Meloxicam was also  given before and after procedures where brain tissue was exposed, i.e. those  for <a>intracerebral</a><a href="#_msocom_4">[SC4]</a>&nbsp;<a href="#_msocom_5">[SC5]</a>&nbsp; injection and window replacement. For all procedures described below,  mice were placed under general anesthesia with isoflurane mixed with oxygen.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="686382" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Headplate installation and  craniotomy</h2><div>We shaved the top of the mouse’s head and sterilized the skin using 70%  alcohol and 7.5% Betadine. We made a 1cm midline sagittal incision through the  scalp using surgical scissors, and retracted laterally using a self-retaining  retractor (WPI, 501968). To prepare the cranial surface, we applied 3% hydrogen  peroxide to oxidize and facilitate removal of periosteal tissue with cotton tip  swabs. The surface was then marked up before headplate installation followed by  craniotomy. We targeted laterally symmetric craniotomies with edge length 2.2  mm centered at coordinates ±1.83 mm lateral to sagittal suture and 1.00 mm  anterior to bregma. First, we used a surgical skin marker (FST, 18000-30) to  roughly indicate the site of each craniotomy and enhance contrast of the edges  to be etched. We etched the corners and edges using a dental drill with a FG  1/4 round carbide burr (Fig. 2 Step 1(L)). This way of marking the edges  facilitates headplate placement and also aids recovery of the intended  craniotomy position despite being covered by semi-transparent adhesive cement  in the following steps.</div><div>We used a custom stereotaxic attachment (Supplementary) to position the headplate  symmetrically aligned with the marked sites, and to hold it horizontal while  bonding to skull. The headplate was anchored directly to the skull using either  opaque or semi-clear quick adhesive cement (Parkell, S380). Subsequently, we  began each craniotomy by drilling along the marked edges (Fig. 2 Step 2(L)). We  frequently stopped to flush debris from the site using sterile saline and an  aspirator. Once separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was  carefully removed using a pair of sharp forceps (FST, 91150-20) and a 45º micro  probe (FST, 10066-15) while keeping the dura intact (Fig. 2 Step 1(R)). At this  point, we either attached the optical window or sealed the area with a layer of  non-toxic silicone adhesive (WPI, KWIK-SIL). </div><div></div><h2 data-label="857857" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Optical insert attachment</h2><div>The optical insert attachment can be performed immediately following  the craniotomy or deferred to the day of injection as described below (Fig. 2  Step 4). First, we filled the headplate chamber with sterile 0.5% agarose  solution, immersing the exposed brain. Enough agarose was added so as to  overflow the walls of the chamber as the window is inserted, ensuring no air  gaps remain in the space between the walls of the chamber and the window, below  the joint to be sealed. Next, the window was placed in the chamber, directly  over the craniotomy, in gentle contact with the exposed tissue. We used a ttaxic  apparatus to adjust the window height and secure its position during  attachment. This was aided by an attachment – similar to that used for  headplate installation – which fixed the angle of the window’s top surface  parallel with that of the headplate. The height adjustment required depressing  the window until full contact was observed between the inner window surface and  the dura. The window was tacked in place by applying an accelerated light-cured  composite (Pentron Clinic, Flow-It ALC) in at least three points, bonding the  window frame to the anterior and posterior walls of the headplate. At this  point the guide was removed and the joint was prepped for sealing. Excess  agarose (polymerized overflow from the window insertion step) was aspirated  away to expose and clean the headplate surface surrounding the window. The  chamber was sealed by filling the joint between headplate and optical insert  with dental cement (Stoelting, 51458) using a P200 pipette. The window surface  was protected by applying a double layer adhesive strip made of gaffers tape  over a transparent adhesive film dressing (3M: Tegaderm, 70200749201).</div><h2 data-label="968366" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Window detachment and replacement</h2><div>The dental cement<a> </a><a href="#_msocom_6">[SC6]</a>&nbsp;connecting the window and headplate was etched away using a dental  drill. Before removing the window, we thoroughly flushed debris from the  surrounding surfaces with sterile saline. <a>Replacement windows were installed using the  same procedures described above for initial attachment. Localizing the  replacement window to the same position was aided by the expansion of  granulation tissue up to the walls of the prior window.</a><a href="#_msocom_7">[SC7]</a>&nbsp; </div><h2 data-label="522790" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Injection</h2><div><a href="#_msocom_8">[SC8]</a>&nbsp;The exposed brain was flushed with sterile saline before and after each  injection. Injections were made using pulled glass micropipettes with inner tip  diameter ranging from 40 and 80 um (WPI, 504949). The micropipette was  initially back-filled with mineral oil, then secured onto a microprocessor  controlled injector (WPI, NANOLITER2010). The micropipette was then  front-loaded with virus or cells using a controller (WPI, Sys-Micro4). In  general, an injection of 230 nL of cells labeled with AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6f  (AV-9-PV3081, Penn Vector Core) at 106 cells/uL, or 230 nL of  AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV2822, Penn Vector Core). Injection was performed  approximately 500 um deep into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min near the  center of the imaging field, while avoiding blood vessels to maximize the  observable cells around the injection site (Fig. 2 Step 3). The micropipette  was left to sit for an additional 2 min at the injection site before slow  withdrawal. </div><h2 data-label="357849" class="ltx_title_subsection"> Wide-field in vivo imaging and  microscope setup</h2><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was  accomplished using a custom microscope equipped with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu,  ORCA Flash 4.0XX), 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3), excitation and emission  filters of XX and XX, a dichroic mirror (XX), and a 10x objective lens  (Mitutoyo, 378-803-3). Mice were positioned under the microscope for imaging  using a custom headplate holder (Supplementary) and allowed to run on an air-supported spherical  treadmill18 as pictured in Figure 2 Step 5. The camera recorded a field-of-view of  approximately 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm using an image resolution of 2048 x 2048 or more  commonly 1024 x 1024. Continuous image sequences were acquired at 40 to 60 frames-per-second  for 5 to 7 minutes. We selected the field to image within each site by roughly  centering around the injection site. To focus the microscope on labeled cells  in the superficial layers of cortex, we focused on the surface vasculature to  find a stable reference, then advanced the focal plane 50 to 150 <a>um until  multiple cells were distinguishable</a><a href="#_msocom_9">[SC9]</a>&nbsp;. A reference image of the selected image was recorded for each site  and used later to reacquire the same field across image sessions. Alignment to  this reference image relied primarily on using the major blood vessels as  landmarks to guide microscope position in the XY plane. Image sequences were  stored for subsequent processing and analysis.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[SC1]</a>Plus silicone  gaskets??</div><div>And tube connectors?? </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/8”  tube connectors?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_2">[SC2]</a>Further  description of mold design and fabrication needed.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_3">[SC3]</a>Go with the description</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_4">[SC4]</a>Intracortical?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_5">[SC5]</a>intracranial?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_6">[SC6]</a>sealing the chamber and</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_7">[SC7]</a>xue, does this  make sense now?
