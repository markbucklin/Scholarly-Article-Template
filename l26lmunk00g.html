Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution. To address this  concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based cranial  window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from  growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed  to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation. Utilizing  the system, we demonstrate a year-long course of wide-field imaging recording the  simultaneous activity in thousands of cortical neurons in awake mice. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>    The  process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. </div><div></div><div>Chronic imaging of&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;neural activity across  progenitor and local cell populations over an extended period will provide a  more complete picture of the integration process than previously available. Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding related to motor activity. We expected the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>First, I approached this problem by developing a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.</div>
