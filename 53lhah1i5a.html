<div></div><h1 data-label="728874" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution. </div><div></div><div>Efforts to overcome  this problem by adding purely mechanical features to the cranial window have  involved attaching spacers made of agarose11,17, silicone18,19  and glass7 to the window’s brain-facing surface that compensate for  the thickness of removed bone. These approaches report delaying tissue regrowth  for up to a few months before optical quality deteriorates. These modest  results indicate a valid basis underlying this approach and suggest that  extending this strategy by starting with a design and material not limited by the  fixed form of flat glass optical windows could yield some improvement.  Additional elements of a chronic cranial imaging window intended to mitigate  degradation by granulation tissue typically target inflammation, the primary  source stimulating the process. These include the aseptic design of seals and  features, selective use of biocompatible materials, and perioperative  administration of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs7,20,21.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>While these designs  have improved longevity, they remain limited in terms of long-term access to  the cortical tissue. The ability to access and manipulate tissue during  real-time imaging opens the door in experimental designs to an expansive  toolbox of neuromanipulation possibilities allowing exploration of uncharted  connectivity and dynamic processes of the brain22. Several  strategies have been reported to gain access to regions below glass cranial  windows by incorporating features such as an access port sealed with elastomer23,  infusion cannula24, or the use of microfluidic channels17.  Nonetheless, the approaches limit the tissue accessibility to a single  designated site predetermined before an experiment begins and do not offer  uniform access over the imaging area.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To address the  relative restrictions using glass as cranial windows, a number of alternative  approaches have highlighted the use of silicone elastomer for cranial windows25–29. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)  is optically clear, non-toxic and chemically inert and can be molded to take  any shape or exhibit any desired feature, not necessarily sacrificing the  imaging field of the window. These properties combine to offer a remarkably  versatile material, particularly favorable for prototype development for  projects with demanding specifications for biocompatibility and optical  performance. A well-known and widely used example is the artificial dura for in  vivo optical imaging in nonhuman primates25,26,30. This chronic implant device is placed in  and covers a craniotomy and sits protected within a chronic cranial recording  chamber. It mitigates tissue regrowth, and interfaces with a cylindrical insert  – also made of PDMS – for optical imaging of neocortex. Additionally, the  artificial dura is thin enough to enable access to underlying tissue for  penetrating electrodes, which penetrate easily and leave a tight seal after  withdrawal. Yet the efforts for translating this design windows for small  research animals using silicone elastomer have thus far been limited (ref). And  a system with long-lasting optical quality and flexible tissue accessibility  remains to be developed or explored for rodent models. </div><div></div><div>In this chapter, Ie  describe a design and demonstrate a two-stage cranial implant device, developed  to facilitate longitudinal imaging experiments in mouse neocortex. The primary  capability requirements for this design are: </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term  stability of an optically clear light-path to cortical surface</div><div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intermittent  physical access to imaged region at any point in study </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The system was  designed considering biocompatibility and optical performance to facilitate  integration in place of the removed bone flap enabling us to achieve sustained  periods of optical quality, extending beyond a year in some mice and allowing  high spatiotemporal resolution using a wide-field microscope. Additionally, the  two-part system consisting of a fixed headplate with integrated neural access  chamber and optical insert, allowed flexible access to the underlying tissue.  The utility of our design is demonstrated through chronic optical imaging of  calcium dynamics in the cortex and acute interventions to the tissue upon  removal and replacement of the cranial window from the headplate. Finally, I demonstrate the technical feasibility  of rapid adaptation of the system that can accommodate varying applications,  further extending our ability to visualize and access neural tissue.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div></div><h1 data-label="728874" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div>Here we report the design for a head-fixation and cranial  window device, and the procedures for surgical attachment.
