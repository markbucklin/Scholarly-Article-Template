The general approach of the method is to seal a cover glass  over an exposed brain region (after craniotomy), to prevent infection and to  maintain the physiological condition of the tissue. However, once the cover  glass is installed, it is difficult to access the brain underlying the window  to inject virus or to deliver drugs or chemicals for any cellular manipulation.  </div>
