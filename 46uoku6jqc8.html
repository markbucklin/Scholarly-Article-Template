<div>Image  sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more  sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras.  Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal  strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal  resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last  decade, this combination of developments has greatly contributed to new optical  techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which has undoubtedly  strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Scientific-CMOS  (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks  at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable  of recording continuous activity of more than one thousand neurons in a  behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional  epifluorescence microscopy. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may  provide better insights into neural coding.&nbsp;</div><div></div>
