<div></div><div>Technical advances  in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes  in real time have provided an unprecedented lens to probe the complex neural  circuits in vivo. Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope with a scientific-CMOS  camera, we can record activity in hundreds of distinct neurons across wide  areas of the brain of awake behaving mice9. Additionally, when  combined with pharmacological manipulation and/or electrophysiological  recording, optical imaging provides a sophisticated approach to investigate  neuronal function within the larger neural network (ref). </div>
