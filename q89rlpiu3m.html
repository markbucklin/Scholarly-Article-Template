Optical recording of neural activity has become increasingly popular in the last few years owing to evolving digital imaging technology, and the development of increasingly effective functional indicators such as the generically encoded fluorescent calcium sensor, GCaMP6f.&nbsp;Using a wide-field fluorescence microscope with a scientific-CMOS  camera, we can record the intin hundreds of distinct neurons across wide  areas of the brain of awake behaving mice. Additionally, when  combined with pharmacological and optical manipulation and/or electrophysiological  recording, optical imaging provides a sophisticated approach to investigate  neuronal function within the larger neural network.&nbsp;    As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment.   &nbsp;</div>
