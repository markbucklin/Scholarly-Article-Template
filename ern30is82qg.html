<div>The therapeutic potential of stem cells,  due to their ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cell types and  capacity for limitless expansion, makes them a promising vehicle for repairing  and replacing damaged cells in neurological diseases.&nbsp;Preliminary clinical  trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease report that  transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem  cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity </div><div></div>
