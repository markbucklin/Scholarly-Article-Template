<div></div><h1>Immunohistochemistry</h1><div>Brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde by perfusion, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound then sectioned coronally at 40 um using a Cryostat. Free-floating sections were immune-stained with chicken anti-GFP (1:250) and rabbit anti-GABA (1:1000). Confocal images were taken using scanning confocal microscope in Micro/Nano Imaging Facility in the Biomedical Engineering department.    </div><div></div><div></div>
