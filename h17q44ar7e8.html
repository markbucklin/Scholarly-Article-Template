<div>In this paper, we report an experimental platform that allows continuous observation of grafted stem cells which could capture the dynamics of integration process inside a living mouse brain. We demonstrated one of many ways to utilize the repeated optical access to the cells by tracing the changes in network-wide calcium dynamics to infer the stages of integration. Histological and electrophysiological assessments have been widely used to characterize the survival, migration, differentiation and functional connections of these cells on brain sections at discrete time points. Here, we demonstrate the utility of in vivo optical imaging that complements these techniques that allows to examine the transplanted stem cells while tracking their fate and function from single mice. For instance, while not covered in this paper, the platform can be used to perform high-resolution multiphoton imaging to visualize the morphological and dendritic development to evaluate the differentiation (REF) and connectivity of grafted stem cells (REF). Additionally, one can use the system to simultaneously record and optogenetically manipulate neural activity to elucidate the synaptic connections between local cells and grafted stem cells (REF). As such, the platform allows numerous ways to assess the developmental process of grafted stem cells in an intact brain, and we can thoroughly characterize the complex sequence of steps required to complete the process.</div><div>The present results demonstrate the capability of the system to capture the dynamics of cellular function of grafted cells throughout the regenerative processes that may provide comprehensive with better temporal information than previously achievable. Intravital imaging have been routinely performed using fluorescence microscopy, yet its utility have been limited by restricted optical clarity during early and later period of window installation due to tissue healing and inflammatory responses and tissue regrowth, respectively, with traditional methods. Alternatively, we developed a polymeric optical window with biocompatible features which remarkably improved the optical accessibility and enabled the observation from the first week during which the cells undergo highly complex and dynamic changes of connectivity to over a year of transplantation, shown in one animal. Additionally, we are first to demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence microscopy to follow the grafted stem cells in living animals which enabled to image with higher spatial and temporal resolution compared to other modalities as reported previously. While we introduce a limited scope of applications using the experimental platform, its utility is expandable beyond calcium dynamic imaging by combining with a new generation of probes available in a variety of function, spectral properties, or subcellular localization and by simultaneous labeling with multiple probes.</div><div>The results further demonstrated the capabilities of the experimental platform to optically dissect the sequence of stages within the developmental process, distinguishable from the longitudinal dynamics of calcium transients of progenitor cells transplanted in a healthy environment of host brain. The grafted cells initially exhibited a highly synchronous network-wide calcium transients with a few asynchronous calcium spiking of individual neurons, then progressively adopted nonperiodic and less-predictable calcium transients of mature neuronal activity. Remarkably, the activity profile and its dynamics were consistent to the characteristic feature critical during early developmental stages of cortical neurons previously reported in vitro and ex vivo, even though the cells were surrounded by host mature neurons. We found the detailed progress of developmental stages analogous to student development during college years. As new student arrive on campus for the first year orientation, the group size is large and the number of group is small similar to the largely synchronous activity of grafted stem cells. As time goes by the large group disperses into smaller groups and continues as students follow their activity, desire and inclination and they are shaped richer and diverse, and the activity become less and less predictable. As information transmission and capacity are essential to cortical functions, the richer activity patterns may illustrate the progression of maximizing the information flow capacity of the developing network (Antonopoulos, 2015).&nbsp;</div><div>Finally, the ability to directly and continuously observe the regenerative process of grafted stem cells in living animals over extended periods could offer a paradigm shift in stem cell observation which may accelerate our knowledge to develop a clinically competitive cell-based therapy. Particularly, since time-lapse imaging permits to visualize the complete development of stem cells and requires fewer animals for meaningful statistical analysis, the platform will be a powerful tool for optimizing the therapeutic efficacy and consistency without the need for rather laborious histological assessments. Most excitingly, the application in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases may reveal the reconstruction process of damaged neural circuits after transplantation, a critical course for functional restoration which remains unclear. We hope the adoption of such experimental platform will provide a time- and resource-efficient means for stem cell studies in animals leading to translational opportunities.</div>
