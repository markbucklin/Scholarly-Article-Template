<div></div><div>Efforts to overcome  this problem by adding purely mechanical features to the cranial window have  involved attaching spacers made of agarose11,17, silicone18,19  and glass7 to the window’s brain-facing surface that compensate for  the thickness of removed bone. These approaches report delaying tissue regrowth  for up to a few months before optical quality deteriorates. These modest  results indicate a valid basis underlying this approach and suggest that  extending this strategy by starting with a design and material not limited by the  fixed form of flat glass optical windows could yield some improvement.  Additional elements of a chronic cranial imaging window intended to mitigate  degradation by granulation tissue typically target inflammation, the primary  source stimulating the process. These include the aseptic design of seals and  features, selective use of biocompatible materials, and perioperative  administration of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs7,20,21.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>While these designs  have improved longevity, they remain limited in terms of long-term access to  the cortical tissue. The ability to access and manipulate tissue during  real-time imaging opens the door in experimental designs to an expansive  toolbox of neuromanipulation possibilities allowing exploration of uncharted  connectivity and dynamic processes of the brain22. Several  strategies have been reported to gain access to regions below glass cranial  windows by incorporating features such as an access port sealed with elastomer23,  infusion cannula24, or the use of microfluidic channels17.  Nonetheless, the approaches limit the tissue accessibility to a single  designated site predetermined before an experiment begins and do not offer  uniform access over the imaging area.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To address the  relative restrictions using glass as cranial windows, a number of alternative  approaches have highlighted the use of silicone elastomer for cranial windows25–29. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)  is optically clear, non-toxic and chemically inert and can be molded to take  any shape or exhibit any desired feature, not necessarily sacrificing the  imaging field of the window. These properties combine to offer a remarkably  versatile material, particularly favorable for prototype development for  projects with demanding specifications for biocompatibility and optical  performance. A well-known and widely used example is the artificial dura for in  vivo optical imaging in nonhuman primates25,26,30. This chronic implant device is placed in  and covers a craniotomy and sits protected within a chronic cranial recording  chamber. It mitigates tissue regrowth, and interfaces with a cylindrical insert  – also made of PDMS – for optical imaging of neocortex. Additionally, the  artificial dura is thin enough to enable access to underlying tissue for  penetrating electrodes, which penetrate easily and leave a tight seal after  withdrawal. Yet the efforts for translating this design windows for small  research animals using silicone elastomer have thus far been limited (ref). And  a system with long-lasting optical quality and flexible tissue accessibility  remains to be developed or explored for rodent models. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Glass cranial  windows have been widely adopted for <i>in  vivo</i> optical imaging because they permit long-term and high-resolution  observation of individual neurons, neural networks or vasculature in various  cortical regions. The general approach of the method is to seal a cover glass  over an exposed brain region (after craniotomy), to prevent infection and to  maintain the physiological condition of the tissue. However, once the cover  glass is installed, it is difficult to access the brain underlying the window  to inject virus or to deliver drugs or chemicals for any cellular manipulation.  </div><div>Thus, cranial  windows with modified designs have been reported that allow repeated injection  of substances into the brain tissue. Recently, a cranial window with an  infusion cannula fixed adjacent to a cover glass has been reported permitting repeated  injections while simultaneously imaging the brain (Zuluaga-Ramirez et al.,  2015). However, this technique is limited to injecting through a cannula that  is placed at one end of the cover glass, resulting in a gradient of the  substance through the brain and an unequal effect within the imaging area.  Another method which has been reported is a cranial window with a drilled hole  sealed with biocompatible polymer, which allows access to the brain and  self-seals after retraction of the pipette (Roome and Kuhn, 2014). Despite the  simple and easy design of the polymer plug, it has been noted that the dura  regrowth under the plug impedes access for injections over time. Lastly, a  removable cranial window has been described that permits viral injection and durotomy  or bone growth removal allowing extended imaging period with enhanced clarity  (Goldey et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the procedure for window removal and  replacement is inconvenient as the dental cement holding the window to the  skull needs to be drilled away and the installation of a new window needs to be  repeated.</div><div>While cover glasses  have been extensively used as cranial windows for <i>in vivo</i> imaging in mice, the use of an alternative material for the  window, such as polymer, has yet to be explored. In primate cortical imaging,  transparent silicone dural substitute has been used to replace the excised dura  and installed in contact with the exposed tissue to protect from infection and  inflammation (Arieli et al., 2002). The dural substitute is made of poly-dimethylsiloxane  (PDMS) that is optically clear and maintains a good optical quality by  preventing tissue regrowth that would otherwise deteriorate the imaging  condition by clouding. Furthermore the material is biocompatible, makes tight  seal to maintain tissue homeostasis, and prevents cortical tissue from  inflammation. In addition to the optical properties of PDMS, I am interested in  exploring the possibility of designing the cranial window using this material  because it provides a softer and more flexible interface to the brain,  potentially causing less irritation as compared to the conventional approach of  using glass.</div><div>Overall, it is  essential to have flexible access to the brain tissue under the window, because  the goal of the project is to image stem cells after transplantation in  cortical tissue. Two criteria are of importance for the imaging system for this  project: (1) the system must provide access to brain under the window for stem  cell transplantation; (2) the cranial window should allow immediate imaging  after the transplantation as well as chronic imaging to capture the critical  period of integration and maturation of the transplanted cells. In this  section, I propose to develop a polymer-based optical imaging system allowing  flexible and repeated access to the brain tissue under the window while  maintaining the improved imaging quality over an extended period. </div>
