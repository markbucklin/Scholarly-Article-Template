<div>One of the  key advantages of in vivo imaging is the ability to observe and record the same  brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes. This ability  relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable  non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue overlying the targeted  brain region. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Attempts to  image neocortical regions on the surface of mouse brain typically use a small  glass disc attached to the cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy.  This approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in  optical quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually  overtakes the fluid-filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue,  and is thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous structure scatters  light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently degrades optical  quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div>
