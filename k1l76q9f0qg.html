<div>One of the  key advantages of in vivo imaging is the ability to observe and record the same  brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes. This ability  relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable  non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue overlying the targeted  brain region. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Attempts to  image neocortical regions on the surface of mouse brain typically use a small  glass disc attached to the cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy.  This approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in  optical quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually  overtakes the fluid-filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue,  and is thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous structure scatters  light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently degrades optical  quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="396197" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term continuous imaging study to follow grafted  stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect  of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger  multicellular networks in vivo has now become both practical and possible.  Using the imaging techniques described above, individual cells can be followed  throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of  viability, distribution, and differentiation, as well as cellular and network  activity from each animal. The dynamic sequence of migration and morphological  development of grafted stem cells can be tracked across days using a  high-resolution volume scanning procedure with a two-photon microscopy. Additionally,  wide-field imaging techniques have been proven effective to study the brain by  monitoring neural activity within a multicellular network at high temporal and  spatial resolution and measuring their response to variable conditions of the external  environment.&nbsp;New types of measurements may emerge from the experimental  approaches and may offer a better reflection of the timing and extent at which  transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural  networks.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Optical  imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation,  which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the  technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed.  Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than  deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue.  However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large of a scale, and the development of such  experimental platforms will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can provide  feedback toward the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                      </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div>
