<div>One of the  key advantages of in vivo imaging is the ability to observe and record the same  brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes. This ability  relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable  non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue overlying the targeted  brain region. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Attempts to  image neocortical regions on the surface of mouse brain typically use a small  glass disc attached to the cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy.  This approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in  optical quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually  overtakes the fluid-filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue,  and is thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous structure scatters  light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently degrades optical  quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="396197" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term continuous imaging study to follow grafted  stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect  of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger  multicellular networks in vivo has now become both practical and possible.  Using the imaging techniques described above, individual cells can be followed  throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of  viability, distribution, and differentiation, as well as cellular and network  activity from each animal. The dynamic sequence of migration and morphological  development of grafted stem cells can be tracked across days using a  high-resolution volume scanning procedure with a two-photon microscopy. Additionally,  wide-field imaging techniques have been proven effective to study the brain by  monitoring neural activity within a multicellular network at high temporal and  spatial resolution and measuring their response to variable conditions of the external  environment.&nbsp;New types of measurements may emerge from the experimental  approaches and may offer a better reflection of the timing and extent at which  transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural  networks.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Optical  imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation,  which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the  technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed.  Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than  deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue.  However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large of a scale, and the development of such  experimental platforms will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can provide  feedback toward the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                      </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div><h2>Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div><div>The integration and the therapeutic implication of grafted MGE  derived-neurons have been widely recognized over the past decade (Alvarez-Dolado  et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2014; Sebe et al., 2014).        &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="151132" class="ltx_title_section">Summary of introduction</h1><ol><li>Stem cells could do amazing things when transplanted into adults, but their challenging to work with</li><li>Other people have tried things to assess the success of their development attempts -&gt; very arduous</li><li>functional fluorescent probes like Gcamp make continous assessment possible</li><li>would work with mice, but simple cranial window approaches are insufficient for the required timeline (optical quality does not persist long enough, is unreliable, restricts phsyical access, and has initial waiting period), SO....</li><li>Chapter 3 I describe a window that meets these requirements and performance exceeds expectations</li><li>Chapter 4 I describe two proof of concept studies that use the above-mentioned device to facilitate long-term continuous imaging of calcium dynamics in two types of stem cells implanted into mouse cortex.

The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process</div>
