<div>In this section, a polymer-based optical imaging implant is proposed  that satisfies the three design criteria. The second design iteration is composed of two  parts, imaging chamber and head-plate, which are reversibly assembled to  facilitate injection and durotomy through detachment, to access the tissue  beneath. The revised design provided access to perform injections and a stable  optical quality maintained over ten weeks.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="956851" class="ltx_title_subsection">Stem cell transplantation and long-term imaging using the imaging platform</h2><div>The reversible assembly of the two parts composing the imaging system enabled repeated access to the underlying brain by detaching the optical window from the headplate. The feature provided flexibility on the time of cell transplantation or virus injection preferably days after craniotomy at which point the inflammatory response resulting from the procedure subsides and the brain clears from any bleeding that would otherwise obstruct the optical clarity during early imaging period. Trials of variable intervals between surgery and injection demonstrated flexible experimental timeline from a day to a week apart, but we advanced with two days due to a higher chance of bone regrowth with longer expansion between the two procedures. Accordingly, surgical procedures including headplate installation and craniotomy were performed two days prior to cell engraftment, -2 day-after-transplantation (DAT). On the day of transplantation, 0 DAT, two distinct sources of progenitor cells of which the integration characteristics have been well established were harvested from the cortex and the medial and lateral ganglionic eminence of E13.5 mouse embryos (REF). </div><div></div><div>Each progenitor cells from these regions are major sources of pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively, in the cortex. Subsequently, we used adeno-associated virus under a strong constitutive promoter, CAG, expressing GCaMP6f to uniformly label these multipotent stem cells to monitor their cellular activities throughout the course of maturation and integration. We first removed the seal covering the exposed brain from the craniotomy performed days in advance, then approximately 200,000 to 250,000 cells were transplanted in the neocortex of an adult recipient mouse preferably near the center of the imaging field and avoiding blood vessels to maximize the observable cells that migrate out from the injection site. The polymeric window was then installed parallel to the headplate ensuring complete seal between the two pieces to prevent infection and to maintain the physiological condition of the tissue while providing optical access to the underlying brain.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Wide-field epifluorescence microscopy was used to acquire the cellular dynamics across hundreds of cells at cellular- and subcellular-resolution during which the mouse was head-restrained and freely moving. Despite the low level of protein expression during earlier period of transduction, we were able to record the calcium activities of grafted cells within the first week of transplantation, generally 3 DAT. The imaging sessions were conducted three to four times a week in the course of the first month during which the progenitor cells migrate and differentiate into neurons and subsequently subsided into a weekly basis as the cells make physical and electrical connections and integrate into recipient’s neural circuits (REF). The imaging system maintained its optical clarity over several months, in some cases lasting over 8 months. The extended period of clarity was achieved as the chemically-inert and biocompatible polymer window was recognized as part of the host system, and granulation tissue formed around the perimeter of the interface between the plug and the brain and prevented tissue growth over the brain which often challenges long-term imaging in the cortex using glass cranial window (REF). The simple procedure of window removal, however, allows access to the brain to perform durotomy or bone growth removal allowing extended imaging period with enhanced clarity as described in a previous work (Goldey et al., 2014).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="462037" class="ltx_title_subsection">Activation characteristic of grafted stem cells traced over months</h2><div>Over the course of imaging across months, surface vasculature was utilized as landmarks to track the locations and the cellular dynamics of identical cells. The location of hundreds of cells were identified by consolidating both static and dynamic features of fluorescence intensity for each imaging session using an automatic computational algorithm. Once the cells were detected, we recorded the time-series of the pixel fluorescence intensity values enclosed within each cellular boundary which preserves the information at the subcellular level. The migratory activity of grafted cells was not fully captured in this experiment as the daily imaging duration of 5 minutes was insufficient relative to the first week during which the majority of migration take place (REF), and the imaging session started a few days into the engraftment as the fluorescence expression was hardly detectable beforehand. However, the post-migration cells were dispersed and sparsely located, and identical cells were easily distinguishable among imaging sessions by comparing the cellular map from each session. For instance, an average of XX % of identical cells on 15 DAT were identified in the cellular map of 250 DAT.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>(INCLUDE: Individual cell report -- Activation characteristic change; shape/intensity; firing rate; auto-correlation; kinetic - activation time, activation duration, amplitude, normal compared to cortical neurons? difference between the sources?)</div><div></div><h2 data-label="745861" class="ltx_title_subsection">Network complexity increase in grafted network development&nbsp;</h2><div>The number of cells detected over the imaging field of XX mm2 maintained in the range of XX - XX, and we didn’t observe significant change in the number of detectable cells among sessions. The network analysis was performed throughout using the entire population of cells detected by the automatic algorithm. The population of grafted progenitor cells of both sources exhibited synchronized activation during the early period of engraftment. The synchronized activation in the cortical progenitor cells lasted for a longer period, and its firing frequency increased from XX during the week to XX by the end of the first month. The cells participating in the coactivation extended to XX % and XX %, respectively during this period. The interneuron progenitor cells, however, had the frequency of co-activation of XX during the first week but decreased to XX beyond the first month. In addition, cells participating in the coactivation was XX and decreased to XX by one month.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The extent of coactivation was measured by correlation coefficient using the fluorescence intensity values were converted into the values into a time-series of cell activation states based on the division by standard deviation (i.e. ON or OFF). As expected from the observation of the change in frequency and percent participation of the coactivation, we observed decrease in correlation in both populations but more in interneuron progenitor cells compared to cortical progenitor cells. We found continuous change beyond the first month as the correlation between cells continue to decrease as the cells increase their randomized individual firing between these synchronized firing over the development period based on correlation analysis. This development stabilized around XX and XX for cortical and interneuron progenitor cells, respectively. While the calcium activity of both origins of progenitor cells continued to become less correlated, the distribution of firing probability of the populations didn’t change much.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The maturation of network was measured by the increase in complexity of the network which was quantified by the amount of information contained in the the network analyzed through compression analysis. In both populations, we observed decrease in compressibility over time and plateauing over time. The initial compressibility was XX, and decreased at a rate of XX, and stabilized at XX. The time that cortical and interneuron progenitor cells plateaued was in the range of XX and XX, respectively, as similar to the pattern of correlation when it plateaued. In contrast, the local cell population showed stable compressibility around XX over time as expected. The compressibility showed that the grafted cells are forming a functional network and the network is maturing to contain more information over time, but the information containing ability does not exceed that of the local cell population. Furthermore, we measured the compressibility in local cell population pre- and post-transplantation of unlabeled interneuron progenitor cells to observe whether the transplantation can bring change in the information containing ability. The pre- and post-transplantation shows fluctuation but not significant indicating a plasticity in the network upon transplantation as previously reported in transplantation in adult mouse brain (REF).</div><div></div><h2 data-label="546756" class="ltx_title_subsection">Functional integration</h2><div>Lastly, we wanted to use the platform to understand what these cells are doing in the host brain and whether the functionality can be observed through host recipient behavior. The cells were transplanted in the motor cortex, and the various motor behaviors were monitored to have a comprehensive aspect of what is happening in the brain in correlation with the motor function as the mouse was fully awake and freely moving on a treadmill, and we monitor using camera and mouse sensor simultaneously. In the passive experiment, where we observed the mouse running behavior to brain function, didn’t see much change. This was the same case in the local cell population. In addition, we observed the brain function after actively stimulating with light to direct the mouse movement. In this experiment, we used light as the mouse tend to move away from the light then shown from behind. We binned the brain activity pre- and post-stimulation to light, and the brain activity was measured to see whether there is a change in function directly related to the light. We observed that upon light shining from the left, the mouse ran towards and right and vice versa. Additionally, the mouse tail oriented towards the movement direction, and the whisker movement increased, and the pupil dilation increased during the stimulation. We observed the there is a observable change in mouse behavior due to light guiding. In the brain, we observed the information being conducted in the brain during the stimulation moment by measuring the compressibility and comparing before and after. We observed that the compressibility decreases post-stimulation by XX indicating the the cellular dynamics are directly working towards the function demonstrated in motions. This was consistent but with less degree compared to the local cell population. As the network got more complicated, the correlation increased as well indicating that the cells are integrating into the local neural network and also functionally participating into the functions. The demonstration shows that the experimental platform can be used to examine the integration extension by measuring the complexity of the network formed as well as how much of this is functional by comparing with the behavior and optically observe the functional integration of grafted stem cells from different sources.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="356224" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>In this paper, we report an experimental platform that allows continuous observation of grafted stem cells which could capture the dynamics of integration process inside a living mouse brain. We demonstrated one of many ways to utilize the repeated optical access to the cells by tracing the changes in network-wide calcium dynamics to infer the stages of integration. Histological and electrophysiological assessments have been widely used to characterize the survival, migration, differentiation and functional connections of these cells on brain sections at discrete time points. Here, we demonstrate the utility of in vivo optical imaging that complements these techniques that allows to examine the transplanted stem cells while tracking their fate and function from single mice. For instance, while not covered in this paper, the platform can be used to perform high-resolution multiphoton imaging to visualize the morphological and dendritic development to evaluate the differentiation (REF) and connectivity of grafted stem cells (REF). Additionally, one can use the system to simultaneously record and optogenetically manipulate neural activity to elucidate the synaptic connections between local cells and grafted stem cells (REF). As such, the platform allows numerous ways to assess the developmental process of grafted stem cells in an intact brain, and we can thoroughly characterize the complex sequence of steps required to complete the process.</div><div></div><div>The present results demonstrate the capability of the system to capture the dynamics of cellular function of grafted cells throughout the regenerative processes that may provide comprehensive with better temporal information than previously achievable. Intravital imaging have been routinely performed using fluorescence microscopy, yet its utility have been limited by restricted optical clarity during early and later period of window installation due to tissue healing and inflammatory responses and tissue regrowth, respectively, with traditional methods. Alternatively, we developed a polymeric optical window with biocompatible features which remarkably improved the optical accessibility and enabled the observation from the first week during which the cells undergo highly complex and dynamic changes of connectivity to over a year of transplantation, shown in one animal. Additionally, we are first to demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence microscopy to follow the grafted stem cells in living animals which enabled to image with higher spatial and temporal resolution compared to other modalities as reported previously. While we introduce a limited scope of applications using the experimental platform, its utility is expandable beyond calcium dynamic imaging by combining with a new generation of probes available in a variety of function, spectral properties, or subcellular localization and by simultaneous labeling with multiple probes.</div><div></div><div>The results further demonstrated the capabilities of the experimental platform to optically dissect the sequence of stages within the developmental process, distinguishable from the longitudinal dynamics of calcium transients of progenitor cells transplanted in a healthy environment of host brain. The grafted cells initially exhibited a highly synchronous network-wide calcium transients with a few asynchronous calcium spiking of individual neurons, then progressively adopted nonperiodic and less-predictable calcium transients of mature neuronal activity. Remarkably, the activity profile and its dynamics were consistent to the characteristic feature critical during early developmental stages of cortical neurons previously reported in vitro and ex vivo, even though the cells were surrounded by host mature neurons. We found the detailed progress of developmental stages analogous to student development during college years. As new student arrive on campus for the first year orientation, the group size is large and the number of group is small similar to the largely synchronous activity of grafted stem cells. As time goes by the large group disperses into smaller groups and continues as students follow their activity, desire and inclination and they are shaped richer and diverse, and the activity become less and less predictable. As information transmission and capacity are essential to cortical functions, the richer activity patterns may illustrate the progression of maximizing the information flow capacity of the developing network (Antonopoulos, 2015).&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Finally, the ability to directly and continuously observe the regenerative process of grafted stem cells in living animals over extended periods could offer a paradigm shift in stem cell observation which may accelerate our knowledge to develop a clinically competitive cell-based therapy. Particularly, since time-lapse imaging permits to visualize the complete development of stem cells and requires fewer animals for meaningful statistical analysis, the platform will be a powerful tool for optimizing the therapeutic efficacy and consistency without the need for rather laborious histological assessments. Most excitingly, the application in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases may reveal the reconstruction process of damaged neural circuits after transplantation, a critical course for functional restoration which remains unclear. We hope the adoption of such experimental platform will provide a time- and resource-efficient means for stem cell studies in animals leading to translational opportunities.</div><div></div>
