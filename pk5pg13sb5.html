<div>In this section, a polymer-based optical imaging implant is proposed  that satisfies the three design criteria. The second design iteration is composed of two  parts, imaging chamber and head-plate, which are reversibly assembled to  facilitate injection and durotomy through detachment, to access the tissue  beneath. The revised design provided access to perform injections and a stable  optical quality maintained over ten weeks.</div>
