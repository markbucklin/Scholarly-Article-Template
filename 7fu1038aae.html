<div></div><div>The therapeutic potential of stem cell transplantation  to replace damaged cells in neurodegenerative diseases has been reported in  several clinical studies. While promising evidence has revealed some detail regarding  the cellular mechanisms underlying cell survival and integration after  transplantation, current methods are largely limited to immunostaining,  electrophysiology, and behavior analysis. Ideally, to understand the  developmental process of grafted stem cells, such as the cellular and neural  networks influencing the functional integration of stem cells, one should track  the same cells throughout the integration process in the living brain. The  goals of the proposed research are to develop an experimental platform for  chronic <i>in vivo </i>optical imaging of  transplanted stem cells and to assess the functional integration of the  grafted cells in correlation with the behavior of the recipient mouse over  an extended period of time. </div><div>Glass  cranial windows have been widely adopted for cortical imaging, however, the  system permits limited access to the tissue for further manipulation after the  initial implantation. For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal. In this section, a polymer-based optical imaging implant is proposed  that satisfies the three design criteria. The first design iteration is  composed of infusion cannulas affixed at two facing edges of an imaging chamber  cast in PDMS. The device allowed stem cell injection into the tissue beneath  the window, but the optical clarity was often compromised by tissue regrowth  shortening the imaging lifetime. The second design iteration is composed of two  parts, imaging chamber and head-plate, which are reversibly assembled to  facilitate injection and durotomy through detachment, to access the tissue  beneath. The revised design provided access to perform injections and a stable  optical quality maintained over ten weeks. </div><div><b>2. Transplant  embryonic progenitor cells in the adult mouse brain and record behavior-related  neural activity using wide-field epifluorescence imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>Previous  studies report that transplanted interneuron progenitor cells retain their  ability to migrate long distances, survive and mature into interneurons, and  integrate into the host neural circuitry. Thus, interneuron progenitor cells,  MGE cells, were selected as the cell source for transplantation for my studies.  I initially assessed stem cell survival under the chamber described in Aim 1 by  injecting GFP labeled stem cells and collecting sections at 3, 7, 14, and 42  DAT. Immunohistology revealed that grafted cells survived and migrated away  from the injection site, presented neuronal morphology at two weeks, and  differentiated into GABAergic interneurons at six weeks after transplantation. Assessing  the chronic stability of the optical window required recording cellular  activity over a long period: cortical and MGE cells were labeled with the GECI  GCaMP6f and imaged during mouse behavior. Fluorescence intensity was recorded using  a wide-field epifluorescence microscope while the head-fixed mouse was moving  on a spherical treadmill. Dynamic cellular activity was observed in both host  cortical neurons and transplanted MGE cells in several sessions recorded up to  43 DAT upon transplantation. Following the acquisition, imaging data are  processed using an automated procedure to segment cells and extract  fluorescence intensity signals over time. Fluctuations in these signals  indicate activation dynamics in dozens of individual MGE-derived neurons. Further  analysis will be directed toward quantification of correlated activity between  cells, cell networks, and mouse behavior. I expect the behavior related to neural  activity in newly grafted cells will be spontaneous and uncorrelated, but that  correlation increases as grafted cells integrate into the host neural network  and participate in behavior functions.</div><div><b>3. Characterize the functional  impact of transplanted cells on behavior-related host neural network activity  using multi-wavelength fluorescence imaging. &nbsp;</b>The  process leading to functional integration of grafted interneurons with existing  host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks; however the complex  sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been  continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. Chronic imaging of <i>in vivo </i>neural activity across  progenitor and local cell populations over an extended period will provide a  more complete picture of the integration process than previously available. In  this section, the impact of grafted MGE cells will be examined by  simultaneously imaging graft and host neural activity, employing additional fluorescent  markers to distinguish neural populations. Data from periodic imaging sessions  will be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated  changes in network information encoding related to motor activity. I expect the  co-activation between cell populations will progressively increase as grafted neurons  form and fine tune connections with host neurons. Furthermore, I expect  co-activation between MGE cells and host neurons to demonstrate cell-type  specific preference. The ability to identify which elements of their particular  host environment are the factors driving success or disruptive factors leading  to failure will be essential towards successful integration for stem cell  therapy.&nbsp; </div>
