<h3 data-label="138739" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">The bottom surface of the headplate is curved to conform to  the dorsal skull surface of a typical mouse. This feature aids alignment during  attachment, and a large surface area enables a strong adhesive bond to the  skull surface. Adhesive cement is applied continuously along all points of  contact to create a permanent bond along the entire perimeter of both sides of  the chamber. The cement applied along this joint effectively seals the bottom  of the aseptic chamber and is critical for its long-term integrity.</h3><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The wide area of skull-to-headplate attachment provides a  mechanically stable coupling between the animal’s skull and the headplate holder,  which is fixed to the microscope table. The headplate is bonded to all skull  plates, which stiffens the skull tremendously. Additional rigidity is provided  by a central support structure that contacts the skull along the sagittal  suture. All these features combine to provide a very rigid attachment to the  mouse cranium, which drastically reduces its motion relative to the imaging  system (Fig 1b). Remaining brain motion is then primarily movement relative to  the skull, and may originate from physiological forces (i.e. cardiorespiratory)  as much as behavioral forces from animal movement; suppressing this  intracranial motion is addressed in the design of the optical insert described  below.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="762057" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Chamber</h3><div>The chamber in the headplate center facilitates intermittent  physical access to neural tissue by protecting the craniotomy sites between tissue  interventions. Once the headplate is bonded to the animal’s skull, the floor of  the chamber is formed by the central support structure that traverses and fuses  the sagittal suture, the skull surface surrounding each craniotomy, and a flat  ledge that extends laterally. The joints between the skull surface edges of the  central support, anterior and posterior walls, and the lateral ledge are sealed  during the headplate attachment procedure. This bottom seal is crucial for  maintaining an aseptic environment for the protection of the exposed brain  tissue. When the dura mater is left intact during the craniotomy, the space  within the chamber is continuous with the epidural space. </div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="297584" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Optical Insert</h3><div>The insert has optically flat top and bottom rectangular  surfaces. The bottom brain-facing surfaces are positioned to form a flat  interface with the intact dura through each craniotomy. The body of the insert  provides a clear optical light-path between top and bottom surfaces. The walls  of the body are tapered to increase the angle of unimpeded light  collection/delivery at the image field. This increases the numerical aperture  for imaging through high power lenses, and also expands options for off-axis  illumination. The tapered body is extended to the brain surface via  vertical-walled columns that traverse each craniotomy. These columns fill the  space made by removal of the bone flap during craniotomy, and their bottom  surface gently flattens the brain tissue, positioning the cortex in a  horizontal plane for convenient wide-field imaging. Both the top and bottom  surfaces are made optically clear by integrating microscope slides in the mold  when casting. The dimensions of the insert are depicted in figure 1-b.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Inserts are fabricated in batches using an optically  transparent silicone elastomer. We vacuum cast the part in a PTFE and glass  mold with an aluminum window frame inclusion that gets embedded near the upper  surface. This frame provides a site for attachment and sealing to the rim of  the chamber, as well as structural reinforcement. This helps to establish and  maintain a flat optical surface at the top of the insert, parallel to the  headplate (Fig 1b). We constructed inserts with the bottom surface parallel to  the top, which works well for imaging medial cortical regions. For imaging  lateral cortical regions (e.g. visual or auditory cortex) the mold can be  adapted to produce inserts that form a flat image plane with consistent controllable  angle relative to the headplate. For any desired angle, this capability greatly  simplifies recording from a consistent image plane across sessions and animals.  The medial cortical region imaged in the demonstration provided here was square  in shape (2 mm X 2 mm), at a horizontal angle of 0 degrees, and extended from  0.83 mm to 2.83 mm symmetrically off the midline (Fig 1a). </div><div> </div><h2 data-label="488500" class="ltx_title_subsection">Installation and Usage</h2><div>The surgical installation procedures for this two-stage cranial  implant device were adapted from a combination of procedures in common use for  attachment of headplates and cranial windows in mice, and similar devices used  for optical imaging in primates. The specific protocol evolved during 3  distinct trial runs, and the final protocol is summarized here and detailed in  methods and materials below. The 18 mice reported here received the same  version of headplate and optical insert. Minor changes were made to the  surgical procedures from one batch to the next, each with discernable effect;  see the discussion for details. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Because this is a two-stage cranial implant device, the  procedure for installation can be separated into multiple distinct surgeries  depending on experimental requirements. The first stage includes headplate  attachment to bare skull, centrally aligned along the AP axis with the  bilateral sites over the cortical region of interest. Once the headplate is  securely bonded, bilateral craniotomy can be made through the skull in the floor  of the chamber. If the second stage of installation is performed separately,  the chamber is given a temporary silicone seal to protect the craniotomy. We  delayed the second stage of installation for at least 2 to 3 days to allow for  mouse recovery.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The second stage involves installation of the optical insert,  and may be directly preceded by injection of virus, pharmaceutical compounds,  exogenous cells, or any other substance of interest. The cranial window is  installed in the chamber with the assistance of a custom stereotaxic attachment,  which enables fine height adjustment and holds the window’s position while  being secured in place. The angle of the window’s top surface is held parallel  with that of the headplate. The chamber is partially filled with sterile  agarose to displace all air from the chamber when the optical insert is lowered  into place. The height is adjusted to provide full contact between the insert’s  bottom surface and the dura, which also places the insert’s frame in close  proximity to the rim of the chamber. Dental cement is applied to form a joint  between the headplate and the window frame of the optical insert, installing  the insert in place and aseptically sealing the chamber. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The optical insert can be removed and replaced at any time  to provide intermittent physical access to the neural tissue and/or for window  replacement (i.e. for mid-experiment injections or window damage repair,  respectively). Removal is relatively easy, accomplished by etching away the  joint between headplate and optical insert. Window replacement uses the same  procedure as the second stage installation described above. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The replacement procedure was attempted 5 times, 4 of which  were successful in preserving or restoring optical quality to “like-new”  condition, without inflicting detectable tissue damage. Three windows were  removed and replaced following damage to the top surface of the optical insert,  inflicted by feisty cage-mates with sharp incisors (at 91, 83, and 172 days  post-installation; 91 days case unsuccessful). The remaining two cranial  windows were removed at 20 days post-installation to facilitate direct tissue  access for grafting exogenous cells to the imaged region. We found that the  removal needs to be performed slowly, taking great care to avoid capillary  rupture in the exposed brain and surrounding granulation tissue. During each of  these procedures, we observed the pattern of granulation tissue growth into the  peripheral area of the chambers. Photos of the typical growth (as observable  with window removed) at day 172 is shown in figure 3-d, and described in more  detail below.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="128230" class="ltx_title_subsection">Evaluation of System Performance</h2><div>Throughout development we installed several prototypes to  test the effect of various features and conditions. The cranial window design  and surgical procedures described in this paper were attempted with 18 mice.  Cranial window condition was evaluated by direct observation and evaluation of  fluorescence dynamics in processed video recorded during periodic 5-minute  imaging sessions. Direct (bright-field) observation with a stereoscopic  microscope was useful for evaluating quality of the optical interface with  brain tissue, as well as for tracking progression of granulation tissue growth  in the surrounding space at the edges of the craniotomy. Analysis of cell  dynamics measures from processed fluorescence imaging video indicated actual  usability of the window for longitudinal studies requiring activity metrics at  a cellular level.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>
