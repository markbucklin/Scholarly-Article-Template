<div>All surgical procedures followed the Boston University IACUC protocol. Surgeries are performed on 6 to 8 weeks old female C57/BL6 mice as the recipients for progenitor cell transplantation. One hour prior to the surgery, dexamethasone (5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary, 07-808-8194) was administered by intramuscular injection to relieve any tissue inflammatory response and to prevent cerebral edema. The mouse was placed under general anesthesia with 1 - 1.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. As pre-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-845-6986) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-891-9756) were administered subcutaneously (SC) to reduce pain and inflammatory responses. The mouse was immobilized on a stereotaxic. The incision area was sterilized using 70% alcohol and XX, then a cut was made along the midline of the brain. The skin was retracted apart laterally using surgical clamps (XX), and 3% H2O2 was applied to remove the periosteum of the skull. Four corners of a square craniotomy over motor cortex with edges of 2.2 mm and center coordinates of 1.83 lateral and 1.00 anterior was lightly etched using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. The etched points were marked over with surgical skin marker (XX), then the edges were etched along the four corners using a dental drill. The marking procedure was necessary to enhance the contrast of the etched areas for accurate placement of the headplate under the semi-transparent dental cement in the step to follow. Utilizing a custom made surgical guide fixed onto the stereotaxic that will hold the headplate horizontal to the plane, the headplate was positioned roughly over the centers between the intended craniotomy regions of both hemispheres and anchored directly onto the skull using C&amp;B Metabond. Once the Metabond hardened, the surgical guide was removed and the excess bone cement covering the etched area was drilled away. Once the skull was exposed, it was cleaned of any debris by irrigating with sterile saline. Subsequently, 2.2 x 2.2 mm2 craniotomy was performed on one or both sides of the hemisphere along the previously marked area using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. Constant flow of sterile saline and and aspirator was used to cool down the brain and to flush out any debris. Once the skull within the craniotomy was separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was carefully removed using a pair of XX forceps (XX) and a Bonn microprobe (XX) while keeping the dura intact without any damage. Sterile saline was used to further clean up the area, and the exposed brain area was sealed using KwikSil (XX). The mouse was then moved for recovery, and for post-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, SC) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, SC) were administered over 48 hour period to reduce inflammation and pain. </div><div></div><div>Prior to injection or cell transplantation, the KwikSil plug covering over the craniotomy was carefully removed from the edges to avoid any capillary rupture below the dura due to the negative pressure created by the seal. The brain was flushed several times with sterile saline before and after the injection procedure. Injections were performed using glass pipettes with an outer tip diameter of 40 â€“ 80 um on Nanofil controlled by MicroXX. The pipette was back-filled with mineral oil then front-loaded with virus or cells. In general, an injection of 230 nL of cells at 10<sup>6</sup> cells/uL or 200 nL of virus (titer) was performed ~ 500 um into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min on each hemisphere. The micropipette was let to sit additional 2 min at the injection site to prevent any overflowing then was withdrawn slowly. </div><div></div><div>Once the injection was completed, sterile 0.5% agarose was used to fill in any air gaps over the exposed brain tissue, and the polymer-based window was placed directly on top of the dura over the craniotomy. Using a custom made guide, the window was held parallel to the headplate and pushed down to compensate for the removed skull thickness. Once the height was adjusted, UV curable dental cement (XX) was used to quickly fix the window in place on the headplate. The guide was moved out of the way, and any agarose that overflow from the window insertion was aspirated out once it polymerized. Dental cement (XX) was then used to seal the rest of the junction between the headplate and the window ensuring air tight seal between the two parts. Gaffers tape on top of wound sealing tape (XX) was used to protect the polymer window from any scratches. Meloxicam (2.5 ug/g) was given every 24 hours over the next 72 hours to reduce any inflammation due to the installation.</div><div>ub</div>
