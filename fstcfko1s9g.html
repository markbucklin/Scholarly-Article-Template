This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases in the order of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before its next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>decorrelated&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Yet the progression of observed synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cells integrated with host has never been observed.
