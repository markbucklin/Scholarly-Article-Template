Initially, the network activity is dominated by highly recurrent pattern of synchronous network activity, referred to as "network bursts". This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before the next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>The early-form neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development through activity-developmental processes. The propagation patterns and frequencies of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation, differentiation, migration and connectivity. This collective form of intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses. Also the transient heightened state of plasticity of immature cells may increase excitability&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>                                  certain features of immature cells, including a high resistance of the  resting cell membrane and prominent low-threshold calcium currents, may enhance  excitability in neurons, which receive little afferent sensory input. network  properties, including an excitatory effect of GABA and the presence of gap  junctions, may permit the propagation of waves of electrical activity.        </div><div></div><div>                                      developmental superbursting is thought to accompany transient states of  heightened plasticity … mediated by depolarizing currents at GABAA  receptors on the maturing neurons that activate voltage-gated Ca2+  channels, which potentiate the activity of NMDA receptors. slow Ca2+  wave-mediated (.1 - .5 Hz( neocortical superbursts are associate with  synapse and network formation</div><div>         </div><div>                                  bursting persists for the lifetime of culture, although the fully  synchronized bursts of young cultures are gradually replace by more spatially  localized burst in maturity. … in vivo, busting occurs during development and  plays a role in establishing appropriate connections. however, this phase lasts  only for days or, at most, weeks. the persistence into maturity of bursting in  culture may then be interpreted as a sign that culture are arrest in their  development.         </div><div>voltage-dependent calcium channels or NMDA receptor</div><div>                                  </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>The evolution of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate with host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit such developmental changes during maturation and integration remain unknown.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Intrinsically  stochastic properties of individual neural progenitor cells are shown by their  spontaneous activity in early development (Spitzer, 2006). . Particularly, in addition  to the release of signaling molecules from the progenitor cells, gap junctions  formed between cells have been reported to be important for this collective  behavior (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010). Previous studies  have shown that neural stem cells form functional gap junctions with cells in  organotypic culture as early as 2 – 18 hours after grafting, suggesting that  gap junction formation is an early form of intercellular communication which  precedes the electrophysiological communication via synapses (Jaderstad et al.,  2010). </div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) and isolated development (in-vitro)... </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity</li></ul><ul><li>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</li></ul><div></div>
