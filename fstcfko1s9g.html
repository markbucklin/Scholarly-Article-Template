The collective  network activity formed by intercellular communication, however, is more  regulated, and this is essential for the development of mature neural network  with the complexity of the brain (Mahadevan et al., 2016). Particularly, in addition  to the release of signaling molecules from the progenitor cells, gap junctions  formed between cells have been reported to be important for this collective  behavior (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010). Previous studies  have shown that neural stem cells form functional gap junctions with cells in  organotypic culture as early as 2 â€“ 18 hours after grafting, suggesting that  gap junction formation is an early form of intercellular communication which  precedes the electrophysiological communication via synapses (Jaderstad et al.,  2010). Imaging the calcium dynamics of multicellular networks has been a  valuable method for monitoring this highly correlated activity among  interconnected cells (Sun et al., 2012; Malmersjo et al., 2013). </div>
