The early-form neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development through activity-developmental processes.&nbsp;The propagation patterns and frequencies of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation, differentiation, migration and connectivity. </div><div></div><div>Initially, the network activity is dominated by highly recurrent pattern of synchronous network activity, referred to as "network bursts". This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before the next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Immature cells during development exhibit transient heightened state of plasticity, thus increasing excitability and mediating the influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors. The collective form of intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses, in addition to release of signaling molecules from these cells     (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010).   Previous studies  have shown that neural stem cells form functional gap junctions with cells in  organotypic culture as early as 2 – 18 hours after grafting.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>The evolution of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate with host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit such developmental changes during maturation and integration and whether such developmental characteristics is important for integration remain to be determined. This feature may yield new biomarker for evaluating functional integration of transplanted stem cells in vivo.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div>                                      </div><div>         </div><div>                                  bursting persists for the lifetime of culture, although the fully  synchronized bursts of young cultures are gradually replace by more spatially  localized burst in maturity. … in vivo, busting occurs during development and  plays a role in establishing appropriate connections. however, this phase lasts  only for days or, at most, weeks. the persistence into maturity of bursting in  culture may then be interpreted as a sign that culture are arrest in their  development.&nbsp;&nbsp;    and isolated development (in-vitro).. Similar patterns were observed in human cell organoid transplanted in mouse cortex.&nbsp;                     &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) . </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity</li></ul><ul><li>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</li></ul><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="340468" class="ltx_title_section">New technology for optical imaging empowers researchers with chronic in vivo observation capability</h1><div>                                  Technical advances  in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. Such technique can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and visualization of interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution, and this modality has become relatively affordable and widely available. Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Just this past year, two more studies pursued&nbsp; similar experimental approaches to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In addition to structural imaging, functional imaging strategies can be applied to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds. Consequently, the scale of these studies were limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells (N &lt; 1~2). Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2>Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h2><div>       Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those preciously available in science-grade cameras. Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last decade, this combination of developments have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which have undoubtedly strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>Scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable of recording continuous activity of greater than one thousand neurons in a behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional epifluorescence microscopy. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may provide better insights into neural coding.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="593217" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse neocortex</h1><h2 data-label="496162" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the key  advantages of in vivo imaging regards the ability to observe and record from  the same brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes.  This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div> </div><h2 data-label="186920" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term Continuous imaging study to follow grafted stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger multicellular networks in vivo has now become both practical and possible. Using the imaging techniques described above, individual cells can be followed throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of viability, distribution, differentiation as well as cellular and network activity from each animal. The dynamic sequence of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells can be tracked across days using a high-resolution volume scanning procedure with a two-photon microscopy. Additionally, wide-field imaging techniques have been proven effective to study the brain by monitoring neural activity within multicellular network at high temporal and spatial resolution and measuring their response to variable conditions of external environment.&nbsp;<span>New types of measurements may emerge from the experimental approaches and may offer a better reflection of timing and extent at which transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural networks.&nbsp;</span></div><div>     </div><div>    Optical imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed. Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue. However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal, and the development of such experimental platform will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can feedback towards the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                  </div><div></div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li><li>what we expect the dynamics to be like</li></ul><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="151132" class="ltx_title_section">Summary of introduction</h1><ol><li>Stem cells could do amazing things when transplanted into adults, but their challenging to work with</li><li>Other people have tried things to assess the success of their development attempts -&gt; very arduous</li><li>functional fluorescent probes like Gcamp make continous assessment possible</li><li>would work with mice, but simple cranial window approaches are insufficient for the required timeline (optical quality does not persist long enough, is unreliable, restricts phsyical access, and has initial waiting period), SO....</li><li>Chapter 3 I describe a window that meets these requirements and performance exceeds expectations</li><li>Chapter 4 I describe two proof of concept studies that use the above-mentioned device to facilitate long-term continuous imaging of calcium dynamics in two types of stem cells implanted into mouse cortex.

The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process</div>
