Initially, the network activity is dominated by highly recurrent pattern of synchronous network activity, referred to as "network bursts". This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before the next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>The early-form neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development through activity-developmental processes.&nbsp;The propagation patterns and frequencies of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation, differentiation, migration and connectivity.</div><div>Immature cells during development exhibit transient heightened state of plasticity, thus increasing excitability and mediating the influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors. Also, the&nbsp;    collective form of intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses, in addition to release of signaling molecules from these cells     (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010).    &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>                                      </div><div>         </div><div>                                  bursting persists for the lifetime of culture, although the fully  synchronized bursts of young cultures are gradually replace by more spatially  localized burst in maturity. … in vivo, busting occurs during development and  plays a role in establishing appropriate connections. however, this phase lasts  only for days or, at most, weeks. the persistence into maturity of bursting in  culture may then be interpreted as a sign that culture are arrest in their  development.         </div><div>                                  </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>The evolution of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate with host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit such developmental changes during maturation and integration remain unknown.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Intrinsically  stochastic properties of individual neural progenitor cells are shown by their  spontaneous activity in early development (Spitzer, 2006). .
