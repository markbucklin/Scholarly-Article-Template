This short burst is 0.5 - 2 seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases in the order of a silent network recovery and a low level activity before its next initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into more spare and decorrelated activity.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>decorrelated&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>This progressive evolution of neural activity has  be followed using a variety of methods.

The collective  network activity formed by intercellular communication, however, is more  regulated, and this is essential for the development of mature neural network  with the complexity of the brain (Mahadevan et al., 2016). Particularly, in addition  to the release of signaling molecules from the progenitor cells, gap junctions  formed between cells have been reported to be important for this collective  behavior (Malmersjo et al., 2013; Jaderstad et al., 2010). Previous studies  have shown that neural stem cells form functional gap junctions with cells in  organotypic culture as early as 2 â€“ 18 hours after grafting, suggesting that  gap junction formation is an early form of intercellular communication which  precedes the electrophysiological communication via synapses (Jaderstad et al.,  2010). Imaging the calcium dynamics of multicellular networks has been a  valuable method for monitoring this highly correlated activity among  interconnected cells (Sun et al., 2012; Malmersjo et al., 2013). </div><div></div><ul><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) and isolated development (in-vitro)... </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity</li></ul><ul><li>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</li></ul><div></div>
