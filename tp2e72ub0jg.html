<h2 data-label="777676" class="ltx_title_subsection">Cranial  Window System       &nbsp;</h2><div>Many design features, and procedures for installation were  introduced and developed to mitigate tissue growth for the sustained optical  quality of the window. Other features were included to enhance imaging  performance in awake behaving animals, to facilitate repeatable localization of  image fields across sessions and animal subjects.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The cranial implant device is composed of two parts: a  headplate with an integrated chamber, and an optical insert. The headplate is  bonded to the dorsal surface of the animal’s skull. The optical insert --  sometimes referred to as a “cranial window” -- seals the chamber and establishes  an optical interface with the animal’s brain through craniotomy sites in the  chamber floor (Fig 1a). </div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="138739" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Headplate</h3><div>The bottom surface of the headplate is curved to conform to  the dorsal skull surface of a typical mouse. This feature aids alignment during  attachment, and a large surface area enables a strong adhesive bond to the  skull surface. Adhesive cement is applied continuously along all points of  contact to create a permanent bond along the entire perimeter of both sides of  the chamber. The cement applied along this joint effectively seals the bottom  of the aseptic chamber and is critical for its long-term integrity.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The wide area of skull-to-headplate attachment provides a  mechanically stable coupling between the animal’s skull and the headplate holder,  which is fixed to the microscope table. The headplate is bonded to all skull  plates, which stiffens the skull tremendously. Additional rigidity is provided  by a central support structure that contacts the skull along the sagittal  suture. All these features combine to provide a very rigid attachment to the  mouse cranium, which drastically reduces its motion relative to the imaging  system (Fig 1b). Remaining brain motion is then primarily movement relative to  the skull, and may originate from physiological forces (i.e. cardiorespiratory)  as much as behavioral forces from animal movement; suppressing this  intracranial motion is addressed in the design of the optical insert described  below.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="762057" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Chamber</h3><div>The chamber in the headplate center facilitates intermittent  physical access to neural tissue by protecting the craniotomy sites between tissue  interventions. Once the headplate is bonded to the animal’s skull, the floor of  the chamber is formed by the central support structure that traverses and fuses  the sagittal suture, the skull surface surrounding each craniotomy, and a flat  ledge that extends laterally. The joints between the skull surface edges of the  central support, anterior and posterior walls, and the lateral ledge are sealed  during the headplate attachment procedure. This bottom seal is crucial for  maintaining an aseptic environment for the protection of the exposed brain  tissue. When the dura mater is left intact during the craniotomy, the space  within the chamber is continuous with the epidural space. </div><h3></h3><h3 data-label="297584" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Optical Insert</h3><div>The insert has optically flat top and bottom rectangular  surfaces. The bottom brain-facing surfaces are positioned to form a flat  interface with the intact dura through each craniotomy. The body of the insert  provides a clear optical light-path between top and bottom surfaces. The walls  of the body are tapered to increase the angle of unimpeded light  collection/delivery at the image field. This increases the numerical aperture  for imaging through high power lenses, and also expands options for off-axis  illumination. The tapered body is extended to the brain surface via  vertical-walled columns that traverse each craniotomy. These columns fill the  space made by removal of the bone flap during craniotomy, and their bottom  surface gently flattens the brain tissue, positioning the cortex in a  horizontal plane for convenient wide-field imaging. Both the top and bottom  surfaces are made optically clear by integrating microscope slides in the mold  when casting. The dimensions of the insert are depicted in figure 1-b.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Inserts are fabricated in batches using an optically  transparent silicone elastomer. We vacuum cast the part in a PTFE and glass  mold with an aluminum window frame inclusion that gets embedded near the upper  surface. This frame provides a site for attachment and sealing to the rim of  the chamber, as well as structural reinforcement. This helps to establish and  maintain a flat optical surface at the top of the insert, parallel to the  headplate (Fig 1b). We constructed inserts with the bottom surface parallel to  the top, which works well for imaging medial cortical regions. For imaging  lateral cortical regions (e.g. visual or auditory cortex) the mold can be  adapted to produce inserts that form a flat image plane with consistent controllable  angle relative to the headplate. For any desired angle, this capability greatly  simplifies recording from a consistent image plane across sessions and animals.  The medial cortical region imaged in the demonstration provided here was square  in shape (2 mm X 2 mm), at a horizontal angle of 0 degrees, and extended from  0.83 mm to 2.83 mm symmetrically off the midline (Fig 1a). </div><div> </div><h2 data-label="488500" class="ltx_title_subsection">Installation and Usage</h2><div>The surgical installation procedures for this two-stage cranial  implant device were adapted from a combination of procedures in common use for  attachment of headplates and cranial windows in mice, and similar devices used  for optical imaging in primates. The specific protocol evolved during 3  distinct trial runs, and the final protocol is summarized here and detailed in  methods and materials below. The 18 mice reported here received the same  version of headplate and optical insert. Minor changes were made to the  surgical procedures from one batch to the next, each with discernable effect;  see the discussion for details. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Because this is a two-stage cranial implant device, the  procedure for installation can be separated into multiple distinct surgeries  depending on experimental requirements. The first stage includes headplate  attachment to bare skull, centrally aligned along the AP axis with the  bilateral sites over the cortical region of interest. Once the headplate is  securely bonded, bilateral craniotomy can be made through the skull in the floor  of the chamber. If the second stage of installation is performed separately,  the chamber is given a temporary silicone seal to protect the craniotomy. We  delayed the second stage of installation for at least 2 to 3 days to allow for  mouse recovery.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The second stage involves installation of the optical insert,  and may be directly preceded by injection of virus, pharmaceutical compounds,  exogenous cells, or any other substance of interest. The cranial window is  installed in the chamber with the assistance of a custom stereotaxic attachment,  which enables fine height adjustment and holds the window’s position while  being secured in place. The angle of the window’s top surface is held parallel  with that of the headplate. The chamber is partially filled with sterile  agarose to displace all air from the chamber when the optical insert is lowered  into place. The height is adjusted to provide full contact between the insert’s  bottom surface and the dura, which also places the insert’s frame in close  proximity to the rim of the chamber. Dental cement is applied to form a joint  between the headplate and the window frame of the optical insert, installing  the insert in place and aseptically sealing the chamber. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The optical insert can be removed and replaced at any time  to provide intermittent physical access to the neural tissue and/or for window  replacement (i.e. for mid-experiment injections or window damage repair,  respectively). Removal is relatively easy, accomplished by etching away the  joint between headplate and optical insert. Window replacement uses the same  procedure as the second stage installation described above. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The replacement procedure was attempted 5 times, 4 of which  were successful in preserving or restoring optical quality to “like-new”  condition, without inflicting detectable tissue damage. Three windows were  removed and replaced following damage to the top surface of the optical insert,  inflicted by feisty cage-mates with sharp incisors (at 91, 83, and 172 days  post-installation; 91 days case unsuccessful). The remaining two cranial  windows were removed at 20 days post-installation to facilitate direct tissue  access for grafting exogenous cells to the imaged region. We found that the  removal needs to be performed slowly, taking great care to avoid capillary  rupture in the exposed brain and surrounding granulation tissue. During each of  these procedures, we observed the pattern of granulation tissue growth into the  peripheral area of the chambers. Photos of the typical growth (as observable  with window removed) at day 172 is shown in figure 3-d, and described in more  detail below.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="128230" class="ltx_title_subsection">Evaluation of System Performance</h2><div>Throughout development we installed several prototypes to  test the effect of various features and conditions. The cranial window design  and surgical procedures described in this paper were attempted with 18 mice.  Cranial window condition was evaluated by direct observation and evaluation of  fluorescence dynamics in processed video recorded during periodic 5-minute  imaging sessions. Direct (bright-field) observation with a stereoscopic  microscope was useful for evaluating quality of the optical interface with  brain tissue, as well as for tracking progression of granulation tissue growth  in the surrounding space at the edges of the craniotomy. Analysis of cell  dynamics measures from processed fluorescence imaging video indicated actual  usability of the window for longitudinal studies requiring activity metrics at  a cellular level.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="369571" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Experimental Batches</h3><div>The first batch served as a short trial-run for the  prototype and procedures whose performance in early tests suggested strong  potential for long-term reliability. We ran the first batch for 4-6 weeks to  get a better assessment of what we could expect for long-term viability. With  this design and minor modifications to the surgical procedure, we felt  comfortable using the window in longitudinal studies with significant  investment of time and resources at stake that would also allow for continuous  assessment of the window’s optical performance in parallel. The first batch (N  = 7) of windows was installed and was evaluated 2-3 times/week for just over 1  month. Several more were installed for use in a long-term imaging study  beginning with the second batch (N = 6), then the last batch (N = 5). The  results of these runs are reported below, summarized in figure 3-b. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="988739" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Sustained Optical Quality Extended over a Year</h3><div>In the first batch of 7 mice, optical quality provided by  the window was more than sufficient to record cell dynamics across both image  regions beginning 4 days post-installation and fluorophore-transfection  procedure and was sustained for several weeks. At 4-6 weeks post-installation  this batch of mice was evaluated and 6 of the 7 mice were discontinued and the  installation procedure was adjusted for the next batch. The decision to  discontinue in each case was based on observed deterioration in either the  health of the mouse (4 out of the 6) or the optical quality of the window (2  out of the 6). See the discussion section for the mechanisms we suspected to  underlay and procedural adjustments made to address these issues.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We continued to observe and image the 7th mouse. Progression of the optical quality and fluorophore  expression characteristics in bilateral image regions is depicted in figure 4  for this mouse. Optical quality at the brain-to-window interface has remained  consistent for longer than 18 months. The structure of granulation tissue  surrounding the window at 12 months is described in detail below and depicted  for this mouse in figure 3-d. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similar to the first batch, the second batch of 6 mice was  observed and recorded for some time (3-5 months) before discontinuing all  except one most exceptional mouse. This mouse received a window replacement at  day 83, and was imaged periodically for 11 months before terminating due to a  health concern unrelated to the surgical procedure.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The imaging period for the last batch was extended without  pre-termination to more thoroughly test the longer-term limits of sustained  optical quality. Of 5 mice, 1 mouse did not recover as promptly as expected  following the craniotomy procedure and was immediately discontinued. We  observed consistent performance on long-term optical quality, extending over 12  months on average among the 8 windows. Half of these windows remain to be  imaged to this day, and the rest were discontinued either followed by capillary  rupture within image field or the deterioration of the health of the aged  animals. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><h3 data-label="210757" class="ltx_title_subsubsection">Direct Observation of the Integrated Chamber</h3><div>We periodically examined the imaging chamber condition in  all implanted mice using a stereoscopic microscope. Degradation of the optical  interface was found frequently in prototypes/procedures that preceded the one  mentioned here. This was observed as progressive extension of a cloudy white  inhomogeneous layer across the brain-facing surface of the optical insert.  Using the design and procedures reported in this paper, this type of  degradation rarely occurred, limited to the cases reported above in Batch 1.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Remarkably, but not unexpectedly, tissue growth surrounding  the insert was evident in all cases, regardless of window quality. The tissue  appeared highly vascularized, and grew from the craniotomy edge outward along  the chamber floor (figure 3-c). This growth is a natural response to the tissue  damage inflicted by any craniotomy procedure. The difference observed here is  only that the growth does not extend under the window. Instead, it forms a  non-adhesive interface with the vertical-walled columns and diverges upward  into the aseptic chamber, replacing the agarose fill between the optical insert  and the adhesive cement covering the skull and chamber floor. To further  investigate the structure of granulation tissue growth into the peripheral  chamber areas we removed the optical insert for unobstructed observation in  several mice. An especially gnarly example from a 6-month duration window is  pictured in figure 3-d. </div><div> </div><h2 data-label="101053" class="ltx_title_subsection">Adaptability</h2><div>We also report here an adaptation of the more thoroughly-tested  headplate and cranial window design described above. The most obvious  difference in the newer design is a substantially larger window, which provides  optical access to the entire dorsal cortex. Additional features were added to  aid window positioning, improve sealing performance, and to simplify  fabrication. Adding the additional design features was made possible by  switching the headplate fabrication process from CNC machining to 3D printing,  as discussed below. Following is a summary of the major changes incorporated in  the latest configuration, included here to demonstrate the adaptability of the  basic design described above.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The height and width of the window frame and chamber were  increased, and the window thickness decreased. Protrusions were added to the  bottom surface of the headplate which follow the lateral edges of the chamber.  These protrusions contact the mouse cranium along the squamosal suture to  maintain a rigid skull-to-headplate attachment despite a reduction in  attachment area and removal of a larger fraction of parietal and frontal bone.  A thin skirt was added to the bottom surface of the optical insert along its  perimeter to help block tissue growth across the imaging area. This is  analogous to the vertical-walled column of the prior design, which compensated  for the skull thickness, but it accommodates the irregular curves of the  endocranium surrounding the larger window. Window installation and height  adjustment are improved by fixing small nuts into the headplate on either side  of the chamber, and using fine-threaded screws to fasten the optical insert in  place. This method of window installation provides a vast improvement over the  dental cement method used with the prior design and facilitates fine  adjustments to the window height. A thin coat of silicone was added to the  chamber's inner walls prior to installation to help seal the upper rim of the  chamber with the outer edge of the optical insert. The tape that was used  previously to protect the top surface of the implant was replaced with a solid  flat magnetically-coupled cap.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="887459" class="ltx_title_section">Discussion</h1><div>The two-stage cranial implant devices described here were developed  to enable reliable long-term optical access and intermittent physical access to  mouse neocortex. Our particular application required bilateral cortical windows  compatible with wide-field imaging through a fluorescence microscope, and  physical access to the underlying tissue for virus-mediated gene delivery and  injection of exogenous labeled cells. Optical access was required as soon as  possible post-installation, and to be sustained for several months. The design  focused on addressing the issue common to other window designs meant for  rodents: progressive degradation of the optical light-path at the  brain-to-window interface caused by highly scattering tissue growth. The optical  insert is molded to fit the chamber and craniotomy, blocking tissue growth and  providing a reliable optical interface for up to one year. Additionally, the  core design can be rapidly adapted to improve performance or for varying  applications.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="626472" class="ltx_title_subsection">Critical Elements</h2><div>In assessing the design presented here, we can point to a  few critical elements that facilitate the maintenance of the long-term optical  quality. Refer to the methods section for the specifics of surgical procedures  for headplate attachment and optical insert installation. These procedures were  established after testing the variable formulations in protocol.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>First, the design of the optical insert must incorporate a  mechanical barrier that fits along the edges of the craniotomy. The barrier  must be continuous along the circumference, and extend as far as the inside  surface of the skull to be effective.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Achieving this tight fit without aggressively impinging on  the brain requires some sort of fine height adjustment capability. The optical insert  must be installed at the correct height during the installation procedure, or  shortly thereafter. The insert must be depressed very slightly until full  contact is made across the entire window, but pressing beyond necessary will  quickly exert an undesired increase in intracranial pressure, increasing  inflammation and adverse outcomes. The mechanism for fine adjustment can be  designed into the system, as is demonstrated in the second design presented  here, or incorporated into the installation procedure, as is done in the first  design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Of particular note, we found that administration of  antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in the days surrounding any major  surgical procedure had a substantial impact on the viability of the optical  interface. We used both corticosteroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, and attempts to exclude either ended poorly more often than not (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Equally critical to the long-term health of the imaging  chamber was the requirement to establish and maintain an air-tight seal between  the chamber and the outside world. This includes a permanent bond between the  chamber and skull, and a reversible bond between the chamber rim and optical  insert. How this is accomplished will be specific to the system design, but it  is absolutely essential.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition to establishing and maintaining an air-tight  seal, it is necessary to eliminate any and all pockets of air within the  chamber. Any air pockets that remain after installation will be susceptible to  bacteria growth and may disrupt normal intracranial and intermembrane  pressures. The system presented here used sterile agarose fill to displace all  air within the chamber prior to sealing. Dead space surrounding the optical insert,  including that temporarily filled with agarose, will fill with fluid and  eventually be overtaken by granulation tissue. This process is helpful to the  maintenance of a aseptic chamber environment, so care should be taken not to  disrupt it. However, an excess of dead space will delay this process, and thus  should be minimized when adapting the design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Many attempts to test variations from the described  procedures indicated that all elements mentioned above are equally critical to  achieving a reliable imaging window with sustained optical quality.  Implementing the procedures as described or something similar should mitigate  the primary obstacle to long-term imaging in mice and other rodents. The need  to pre-terminate imaging experiments due to optical light-path disruption by  tissue ingrowth should be substantially reduced. This capability will  drastically reduce wasted time and resources for experiments of any duration,  and will facilitate previously infeasible studies requiring long-term  observation such as for research in aging or the progression chronic neurological  disorders.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="651583" class="ltx_title_subsection">Staging Implant Installation &amp; Tissue Access</h2><div>Configuring the implant as described, so as to enable a  staged installation of multiple parts enables surgical procedures to be spread  across multiple days. This capability offers a number of advantages. It may  save time and resources -- particularly during the prototype stages -- by  allowing time to ensure each implanted mouse fully recovers from the initial  procedure. Additionally, the delay between surgeries allows the heightened  inflammation and other immune system response triggered by craniotomy to  normalize before attempting a tissue intervention that is sensitive to these  conditions (e.g. viral or cell injections) (ref). Through this mechanism the  system offers the capability to image the first tissue intervention from day 0.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similarly, designing the system to be installable in  multiple stages enables trivial and repeatable tissue access at later time  points by simple reversal of procedure for optical insert installation. The  process may be comparable to a previously reported method of removing the  entire glass window to access the tissue (ref). With this system, however, the  methods used to remove and replace are faster and simpler and carry less risk  of tissue damage compared. Additionally, the described methods of facilitating  tissue access can be advantageous over a fixed access port by providing full  access without compromising the image field (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="415096" class="ltx_title_subsection">Design Adaptation</h2><div>While the specific designs described in this report have  much to offer, the greatest asset of the underlying system is its easy  adaptability. The design can be rapidly transformed to accommodate various  applications or to modify its performance in response to new technologies and  demands. This rapid adaptability was a primary goal of this project, and  informed our design and engineering decisions throughout development. Anyone  with access to common laboratory equipment and moderate engineering and  fabrication skills can produce a system to fit their particular needs. As an inherent  aspect of any design process, the adaptation of the original design evolved  over the course of prototyping and testing. In presenting two designs in this  report, our intention was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of  continuous development of a future-proof system. The original system was  adapted to accommodate the continuous evolution of image sensor technology,  particularly the growth in size and resolution, expanding the field of view and  allowing simultaneous access to cellular interactions across multiple brain  regions using wide-field imaging (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The iterative process used here was only made possible by  using the now widely available rapid prototyping procedures, 3D-printing and  laser-cutting -- major progress of manufacturing and its increased versatility,  providing better quality, customization, lower cost and shorter production time  (ref). In an effort to compare various manufacturing technologies, we explored  manufacturing the finalized product design through a number of companies and  advanced with 3D metal printing with overall satisfaction at i.materialise --  we had also developed the parts through other rapid prototyping companies  including Shapeways and Sculpteo.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="322223" class="ltx_title_subsection">Future Improvements</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="147941" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conclusion</h2><div></div><div></div>
