<div>Many design features, and procedures for installation were  introduced and developed to mitigate tissue growth for the sustained optical  quality of the window. Other features were included to enhance imaging  performance in awake behaving animals, to facilitate repeatable localization of  image fields across sessions and animal subjects.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The cranial implant device is composed of two parts: a  headplate with an integrated chamber, and an optical insert. The headplate is  bonded to the dorsal surface of the animal’s skull. The optical insert --  sometimes referred to as a “cranial window” -- seals the chamber and establishes  an optical interface with the animal’s brain through craniotomy sites in the  chamber floor (Fig 1a). </div><h3></h3>
