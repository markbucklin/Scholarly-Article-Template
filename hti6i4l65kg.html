<div>&nbsp;In the first batch of 7 mice, optical quality provided by  the window was more than sufficient to record cell dynamics across both image  regions beginning 4 days post-installation and fluorophore-transfection  procedure and was sustained for several weeks. At 4-6 weeks post-installation  this batch of mice was evaluated and 6 of the 7 mice were discontinued and the  installation procedure was adjusted for the next batch. The decision to  discontinue in each case was based on observed deterioration in either the  health of the mouse (4 out of the 6) or the optical quality of the window (2  out of the 6). See the discussion section for the mechanisms we suspected to  underlay and procedural adjustments made to address these issues.</div><div>We continued to observe and image the 7th mouse. Progression of the optical quality and fluorophore  expression characteristics in bilateral image regions is depicted in figure 4  for this mouse. Optical quality at the brain-to-window interface has remained  consistent for longer than 18 months. The structure of granulation tissue  surrounding the window at 12 months is described in detail below and depicted  for this mouse in figure 3-d. </div><div>Similar to the first batch, the second batch of 6 mice was  observed and recorded for some time (3-5 months) before discontinuing all  except one most exceptional mouse. This mouse received a window replacement at  day 83, and was imaged periodically for 11 months before terminating due to a  health concern unrelated to the surgical procedure.</div><div>The imaging period for the last batch was extended without  pre-termination to more thoroughly test the longer-term limits of sustained  optical quality. Of 5 mice, 1 mouse did not recover as promptly as expected  following the craniotomy procedure and was immediately discontinued. We  observed consistent performance on long-term optical quality, extending over 12  months on average among the 8 windows. Half of these windows remain to be  imaged to this day, and the rest were discontinued either followed by capillary  rupture within image field or the deterioration of the health of the aged  animals. </div>
