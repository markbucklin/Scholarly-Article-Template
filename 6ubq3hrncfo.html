<div>In assessing the design presented here, we can point to a  few critical elements that facilitate the maintenance of the long-term optical  quality. Refer to the methods section for the specifics of surgical procedures  for headplate attachment and optical insert installation. These procedures were  established after testing the variable formulations in protocol.</div><div>First, the design of the optical insert must incorporate a  mechanical barrier that fits along the edges of the craniotomy. The barrier  must be continuous along the circumference, and extend as far as the inside  surface of the skull to be effective.</div><div>Achieving this tight fit without aggressively impinging on  the brain requires some sort of fine height adjustment capability. The optical insert  must be installed at the correct height during the installation procedure, or  shortly thereafter. The insert must be depressed very slightly until full  contact is made across the entire window, but pressing beyond necessary will  quickly exert an undesired increase in intracranial pressure, increasing  inflammation and adverse outcomes. The mechanism for fine adjustment can be  designed into the system, as is demonstrated in the second design presented  here, or incorporated into the installation procedure, as is done in the first  design.</div><div>Of particular note, we found that administration of  antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in the days surrounding any major  surgical procedure had a substantial impact on the viability of the optical  interface. We used both corticosteroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, and attempts to exclude either ended poorly more often than not (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Equally critical to the long-term health of the imaging  chamber was the requirement to establish and maintain an air-tight seal between  the chamber and the outside world. This includes a permanent bond between the  chamber and skull, and a reversible bond between the chamber rim and optical  insert. How this is accomplished will be specific to the system design, but it  is absolutely essential.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition to establishing and maintaining an air-tight  seal, it is necessary to eliminate any and all pockets of air within the  chamber. Any air pockets that remain after installation will be susceptible to  bacteria growth and may disrupt normal intracranial and intermembrane  pressures. The system presented here used sterile agarose fill to displace all  air within the chamber prior to sealing. Dead space surrounding the optical insert,  including that temporarily filled with agarose, will fill with fluid and  eventually be overtaken by granulation tissue. This process is helpful to the  maintenance of a aseptic chamber environment, so care should be taken not to  disrupt it. However, an excess of dead space will delay this process, and thus  should be minimized when adapting the design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Many attempts to test variations from the described  procedures indicated that all elements mentioned above are equally critical to  achieving a reliable imaging window with sustained optical quality.  Implementing the procedures as described or something similar should mitigate  the primary obstacle to long-term imaging in mice and other rodents. The need  to pre-terminate imaging experiments due to optical light-path disruption by  tissue ingrowth should be substantially reduced. This capability will  drastically reduce wasted time and resources for experiments of any duration,  and will facilitate previously infeasible studies requiring long-term  observation such as for research in aging or the progression chronic neurological  disorders.</div>
