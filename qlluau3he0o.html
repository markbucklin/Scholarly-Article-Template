<div>The number of cells detected over the imaging field of XX mm2 maintained in the range of XX - XX, and we didn’t observe significant change in the number of detectable cells among sessions. The network analysis was performed throughout using the entire population of cells detected by the automatic algorithm. The population of grafted progenitor cells of both sources exhibited synchronized activation during the early period of engraftment. The synchronized activation in the cortical progenitor cells lasted for a longer period, and its firing frequency increased from XX during the week to XX by the end of the first month. The cells participating in the coactivation extended to XX % and XX %, respectively during this period. The interneuron progenitor cells, however, had the frequency of co-activation of XX during the first week but decreased to XX beyond the first month. In addition, cells participating in the coactivation was XX and decreased to XX by one month.&nbsp;</div><div>The extent of coactivation was measured by correlation coefficient using the fluorescence intensity values were converted into the values into a time-series of cell activation states based on the division by standard deviation (i.e. ON or OFF). As expected from the observation of the change in frequency and percent participation of the coactivation, we observed decrease in correlation in both populations but more in interneuron progenitor cells compared to cortical progenitor cells. We found continuous change beyond the first month as the correlation between cells continue to decrease as the cells increase their randomized individual firing between these synchronized firing over the development period based on correlation analysis. This development stabilized around XX and XX for cortical and interneuron progenitor cells, respectively. While the calcium activity of both origins of progenitor cells continued to become less correlated, the distribution of firing probability of the populations didn’t change much.&nbsp;</div><div>The maturation of network was measured by the increase in complexity of the network which was quantified by the amount of information contained in the the network analyzed through compression analysis. In both populations, we observed decrease in compressibility over time and plateauing over time. The initial compressibility was XX, and decreased at a rate of XX, and stabilized at XX. The time that cortical and interneuron progenitor cells plateaued was in the range of XX and XX, respectively, as similar to the pattern of correlation when it plateaued. In contrast, the local cell population showed stable compressibility around XX over time as expected. The compressibility showed that the grafted cells are forming a functional network and the network is maturing to contain more information over time, but the information containing ability does not exceed that of the local cell population. Furthermore, we measured the compressibility in local cell population pre- and post-transplantation of unlabeled interneuron progenitor cells to observe whether the transplantation can bring change in the information containing ability. The pre- and post-transplantation shows fluctuation but not significant indicating a plasticity in the network upon transplantation as previously reported in transplantation in adult mouse brain (REF).</div>
