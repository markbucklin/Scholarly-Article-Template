<div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Glass  cranial windows have been widely adopted for cortical imaging, however, the  system permits limited access to the tissue for further manipulation after the  initial implantation. For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a  system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at  which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of  integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the  stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the  study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth  removal. </div><div></div><div>The  goals of the proposed research are to develop an experimental platform for  chronic&nbsp;<i>in vivo&nbsp;</i>optical imaging of  transplanted stem cells and to assess the functional integration of the  grafted cells in correlation with the behavior of the recipient mouse over  an extended period of time.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>In this section, a polymer-based optical imaging implant is proposed  that satisfies the three design criteria. The second design iteration is composed of two  parts, imaging chamber and head-plate, which are reversibly assembled to  facilitate injection and durotomy through detachment, to access the tissue  beneath. The revised design provided access to perform injections and a stable  optical quality maintained over ten weeks.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div>Another in vivo imaging modalities to monitor grafted cells include fluorescence imaging. The technique provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. </div><div></div><div>Other fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence of events.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Recording neural activity using optical technique has been performed for many years but has become increasingly popular recently owing to the technical advancement of larger, faster, and more sensitive imaging sensors combined with new generations of Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) that can report neural activity with extremely high fidelity. These development have enabled to open a wider channel to the brain than previously possible and to simultaneously record the neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment. Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells. (behavior tracking)</div><div></div><div>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process, but the use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications to reveal novel aspects of the process that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.</div><div></div><div>In this section, I propose to integrate  the transplantation procedure of MGE cells with the imaging system developed in  the previous section to monitor the functional integration of the grafted cells  using chronic imaging over the same area. By labeling stem cells with GECI, the  imaging technique will allow a more thorough assessment of the functional  connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain, whereas electrophysiology is  restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or two target regions. The utility of the platform will be tested by  performing periodic structural and dynamic imaging procedures to track the  development of grafted stem cells as they migrate through host cortex and  functionally integrate with host neural network. Migration of cells and changes  in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning procedure  with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across sessions. Additionally,  continual imaging over a region will give us the ability to track the stem  cells along with their change in cellular activities upon transplantation in which  temporal and spatial information is simultaneously acquired. I will also record  the running behavior of the mice utilizing a ball treadmill on which the mouse  can run freely during the imaging sessions. Additionally, we can use  information theory to produce measurements of neural activity as it relates to  behavior. Specifically, mutual information (i.e. cross-correlation) between  network activity and behavior (movement) can be calculated in which the measure  indicates the functional integration of cells in the host neural network  presumably responsible for corresponding behavior. </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="683539" class="ltx_title_section">Results</h1><div></div><div></div><div>Previous  studies report that transplanted interneuron progenitor cells retain their  ability to migrate long distances, survive and mature into interneurons, and  integrate into the host neural circuitry. Thus, interneuron progenitor cells,  MGE cells, were selected as the cell source for transplantation for my studies.  I initially assessed stem cell survival under the chamber described in Aim 1 by  injecting GFP labeled stem cells and collecting sections at 3, 7, 14, and 42  DAT. Immunohistology revealed that grafted cells survived and migrated away  from the injection site, presented neuronal morphology at two weeks, and  differentiated into GABAergic interneurons at six weeks after transplantation. Assessing  the chronic stability of the optical window required recording cellular  activity over a long period: cortical and MGE cells were labeled with the GECI  GCaMP6f and imaged during mouse behavior. Fluorescence intensity was recorded using  a wide-field epifluorescence microscope while the head-fixed mouse was moving  on a spherical treadmill. Dynamic cellular activity was observed in both host  cortical neurons and transplanted MGE cells in several sessions recorded up to  43 DAT upon transplantation. Following the acquisition, imaging data are  processed using an automated procedure to segment cells and extract  fluorescence intensity signals over time. Fluctuations in these signals  indicate activation dynamics in dozens of individual MGE-derived neurons. Further  analysis will be directed toward quantification of correlated activity between  cells, cell networks, and mouse behavior. I expect the behavior related to neural  activity in newly grafted cells will be spontaneous and uncorrelated, but that  correlation increases as grafted cells integrate into the host neural network  and participate in behavior functions.</div>
