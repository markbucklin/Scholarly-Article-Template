<div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various labeling strategies and imaging modalities. For instance, the dynamic sequence of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells have been followed over extended period using magnetic resonance imaging in animals and humans. Yet despite the non-invasive imaging approach in large tissue volumes, the spatial and temporal resolution is currently limited by the low signal strengths of labels, and experimental equipments that can yield strong magnetic field may not be readily available for research due to their cost. Another in vivo imaging modalities to monitor grafted cells include fluorescence imaging. A recent report demonstrated longitudinal observation of the dynamics of morphological integration and synaptic reinnervation of grafted stem cells using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. The technique provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. Other fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence of events.</div><div></div><div>What is yet to be explored is the process hos the cells become integrated and actually function as mature cells. Early neural dynamics during development in normal/endogenous cells is characterized by recurrent spontaneous bursts along the network of cells. At first this is patterned by burst-silent-small activation then gradually transition to bust-small activation with more cells starting to fire individually. In a mature brain, replacement of network bursting with asynchronous individual cellular activity/diversification/desynchronous, which can more effectively carry information as the role of the brain. </div><div></div><div>This synchronous activity is transmitted from one cell to another through gap junctions rather than synaptic connections. At this stage during development, the immature cells are more sensitive to activation, due to heightened excitability with high membrane resistance and chloride playing a role for activation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Synchronous activity has been reported to play a critical role in normal development of cortical tissue.

These development have enabled to open a wider channel to the brain than previously possible and to simultaneously record the neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment. Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells. <i>(behavior tracking)</i> </div><div></div><h1 data-label="488593" class="ltx_title_section">Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h1><div>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process, but the use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications to reveal novel aspects of the process that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy. </div>
