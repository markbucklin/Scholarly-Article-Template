<div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various labeling strategies and imaging modalities. For instance, the dynamic sequence of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells have been followed over extended period using magnetic resonance imaging in animals and humans. Yet despite the non-invasive imaging approach in large tissue volumes, the spatial and temporal resolution is currently limited by the low signal strengths of labels, and experimental equipments that can yield strong magnetic field may not be readily available for research due to their cost. Another in vivo imaging modalities to monitor grafted cells include fluorescence imaging. A recent report demonstrated longitudinal observation of the dynamics of morphological integration and synaptic reinnervation of grafted stem cells using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. The technique provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. Other fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence of events.  </div><div></div>
