<div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various labeling strategies and imaging modalities. For instance, the dynamic sequence of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells have been followed over extended period using magnetic resonance imaging in animals and humans. Yet despite the non-invasive imaging approach in large tissue volumes, the spatial and temporal resolution is currently limited by the low signal strengths of labels, and experimental equipments that can yield strong magnetic field may not be readily available for research due to their cost. Another in vivo imaging modalities to monitor grafted cells include fluorescence imaging. A recent report demonstrated longitudinal observation of the dynamics of morphological integration and synaptic reinnervation of grafted stem cells using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. The technique provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. Other fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence of events.</div><div></div><div>What is yet to be explored is the process hos the cells become integrated and actually function as mature cells. Early neural dynamics during development in normal/endogenous cells is characterized by recurrent spontaneous bursts along the network of cells. At first this is patterned by burst-silent-small activation then gradually transition to bust-small activation with more cells starting to fire individually. In a mature brain, replacement of network bursting with asynchronous individual cellular activity/diversification/desynchronous, which can more effectively carry information as the role of the brain. </div><div></div><div>This synchronous activity is transmitted from one cell to another through gap junctions rather than synaptic connections. At this stage during development, the immature cells are more sensitive to activation, due to heightened excitability with high membrane resistance and chloride playing a role for activation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Synchronous activity has been reported to play a critical role in normal development of cortical tissue. The activation patter is efficient to communicate for this early stages to control various aspect including, survival, migration and anatomical pattern generation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The transition in activity correlates with the development of synaptic connections between cells. Similar activation pattern can be observed in culture cells, but does not mature into complex activation patterns, possible inferring halter development. Similar patterns were observed in human cell organoid transplanted in mouse cortex.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>It has yet been explored whether a well-characterized stem cell source has these activation properties of immature cells and able to mature into a complex network as in native developmental processes. I will explore this in this dissertation by selecting two source of stem cells.&nbsp;</div><div>  </div><div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  exhibiting a highly recurrent synchronous  network activity … gradually replaced by more sparse and decorrelated neural  firings</div><div>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  important for generating proper spatial patterns  of innervation and a network state that allows for more efficient neural  coding, respectively</div><div>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  whether stem cells display comparable  characteristic dynamics of those of embryonic cortical neurons remains largely  unknown in vivo </div><div>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  and whether the properties are crucial for integration  </div>
