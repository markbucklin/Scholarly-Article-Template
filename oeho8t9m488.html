For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div><div>The integration and the therapeutic implication of grafted MGE  derived-neurons have been widely recognized over the past decade (Alvarez-Dolado  et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2014; Sebe et al., 2014).        &nbsp;</div><div></div>
