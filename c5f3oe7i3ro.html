Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>"The early-form neural activity is known to play a key role in proper  cortical development through activity-developmental processes "</div><div>"                                  it will be interesting whether these properties are critical for  integration and whether these neurons display comparable synaptic plasticity  characteristic to those of immature cells.
