<div>Technical  advances in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular  processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural  networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used  for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as  Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins.  This also includes optical imaging modalities such as confocal microscopy,  multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div>High-resolution  volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging  with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. This technique  can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and  subcellular resolutions and visualization of interactions between cells in  their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also helps to visualize  anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution,  and this modality has become relatively affordable and widely available. Falkner  et al. were first to report the use of the technique to track the regenerative  processes of transplanted stem cells. Just this past year, two more studies by  Real et al. and Mansour et al.&nbsp;pursued&nbsp;similar  experimental approaches to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration  and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div>In addition  to structural imaging, functional imaging strategies can be applied to monitor  neural activity, which should allow for a more integrative assessment of  graft-to-host connectivity. &nbsp;In the studies  referred to above, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for  functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in  anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate  cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of  view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal  resolution on a time scale of milliseconds. Consequently, the scale of these  studies was limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells (N  &lt; 1~2). Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute  long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging  modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div>
