<div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="612980" class="ltx_title_section">New technology for optical imaging  empowers researchers with chronic in vivo observation capability</h1><div>Technical  advances in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular  processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural  networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used  for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as  Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins.  This also includes optical imaging modalities such as confocal microscopy,  multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>High-resolution  volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging  with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. This technique  can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and  subcellular resolutions and visualization of interactions between cells in  their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also helps to visualize  anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution,  and this modality has become relatively affordable and widely available. Falkner  et al. were first to report the use of the technique to track the regenerative  processes of transplanted stem cells. Just this past year, two more studies by  Real et al. and Mansour et al.&nbsp;pursued&nbsp;similar  experimental approaches to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration  and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition  to structural imaging, functional imaging strategies can be applied to monitor  neural activity, which should allow for a more integrative assessment of  graft-to-host connectivity. &nbsp;In the studies  referred to above, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for  functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in  anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate  cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of  view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal  resolution on a time scale of milliseconds. Consequently, the scale of these  studies was limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells (N  &lt; 1~2). Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute  long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging  modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><h2 data-label="544170" class="ltx_title_subsection">Imaging calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h2><div>Image  sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more  sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras.  Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal  strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal  resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last  decade, this combination of developments has greatly contributed to new optical  techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which has undoubtedly  strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Scientific-CMOS  (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks  at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable  of recording continuous activity of more than one thousand neurons in a  behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional  epifluorescence microscopy. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may  provide better insights into neural coding.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h1 data-label="573554" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse  neocortex</h1><h2 data-label="266329" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the  key advantages of in vivo imaging is the ability to observe and record the same  brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes. This ability  relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable  non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue overlying the targeted  brain region. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Attempts to  image neocortical regions on the surface of mouse brain typically use a small  glass disc attached to the cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy.  This approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in  optical quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually  overtakes the fluid-filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue,  and is thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous structure scatters  light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently degrades optical  quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="396197" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term continuous imaging study to follow grafted  stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect  of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger  multicellular networks in vivo has now become both practical and possible.  Using the imaging techniques described above, individual cells can be followed  throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of  viability, distribution, and differentiation, as well as cellular and network  activity from each animal. The dynamic sequence of migration and morphological  development of grafted stem cells can be tracked across days using a  high-resolution volume scanning procedure with a two-photon microscopy. Additionally,  wide-field imaging techniques have been proven effective to study the brain by  monitoring neural activity within a multicellular network at high temporal and  spatial resolution and measuring their response to variable conditions of the external  environment.&nbsp;New types of measurements may emerge from the experimental  approaches and may offer a better reflection of the timing and extent at which  transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural  networks.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Optical  imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation,  which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the  technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed.  Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than  deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue.  However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large of a scale, and the development of such  experimental platforms will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can provide  feedback toward the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                      </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div><h2>Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div><div>The integration and the therapeutic implication of grafted MGE  derived-neurons have been widely recognized over the past decade (Alvarez-Dolado  et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2014; Sebe et al., 2014).        &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="151132" class="ltx_title_section">Summary of introduction</h1><ol><li>Stem cells could do amazing things when transplanted into adults, but their challenging to work with</li><li>Other people have tried things to assess the success of their development attempts -&gt; very arduous</li><li>functional fluorescent probes like Gcamp make continous assessment possible</li><li>would work with mice, but simple cranial window approaches are insufficient for the required timeline (optical quality does not persist long enough, is unreliable, restricts phsyical access, and has initial waiting period), SO....</li><li>Chapter 3 I describe a window that meets these requirements and performance exceeds expectations</li><li>Chapter 4 I describe two proof of concept studies that use the above-mentioned device to facilitate long-term continuous imaging of calcium dynamics in two types of stem cells implanted into mouse cortex.

The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process</div>
