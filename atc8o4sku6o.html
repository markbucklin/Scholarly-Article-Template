<div>&nbsp;While the specific designs described in this report have  much to offer, the greatest asset of the underlying system is its easy  adaptability. The design can be rapidly transformed to accommodate various  applications or to modify its performance in response to new technologies and  demands. This rapid adaptability was a primary goal of this project, and  informed our design and engineering decisions throughout development. Anyone  with access to common laboratory equipment and moderate engineering and  fabrication skills can produce a system to fit their particular needs. As an inherent  aspect of any design process, the adaptation of the original design evolved  over the course of prototyping and testing. In presenting two designs in this  report, our intention was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of  continuous development of a future-proof system. The original system was  adapted to accommodate the continuous evolution of image sensor technology,  particularly the growth in size and resolution, expanding the field of view and  allowing simultaneous access to cellular interactions across multiple brain  regions using wide-field imaging (ref).</div><div>The iterative process used here was only made possible by  using the now widely available rapid prototyping procedures, 3D-printing and  laser-cutting -- major progress of manufacturing and its increased versatility,  providing better quality, customization, lower cost and shorter production time  (ref). In an effort to compare various manufacturing technologies, we explored  manufacturing the finalized product design through a number of companies and  advanced with 3D metal printing with overall satisfaction at i.materialise --  we had also developed the parts through other rapid prototyping companies  including Shapeways and Sculpteo.</div>
