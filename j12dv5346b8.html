Thus, interneuron progenitor cells,  MGE cells, were selected as the cell source for transplantation for my studies.  I initially assessed stem cell survival under the chamber described in Aim 1 by  injecting GFP labeled stem cells and collecting sections at 3, 7, 14, and 42  DAT. Immunohistology revealed that grafted cells survived and migrated away  from the injection site, presented neuronal morphology at two weeks, and  differentiated into GABAergic interneurons at six weeks after transplantation. Assessing  the chronic stability of the optical window required recording cellular  activity over a long period: cortical and MGE cells were labeled with the GECI  GCaMP6f and imaged during mouse behavior. Fluorescence intensity was recorded using  a wide-field epifluorescence microscope while the head-fixed mouse was moving  on a spherical treadmill. Dynamic cellular activity was observed in both host  cortical neurons and transplanted MGE cells in several sessions recorded up to  43 DAT upon transplantation. Following the acquisition, imaging data are  processed using an automated procedure to segment cells and extract  fluorescence intensity signals over time. Fluctuations in these signals  indicate activation dynamics in dozens of individual MGE-derived neurons. Further  analysis will be directed toward quantification of correlated activity between  cells, cell networks, and mouse behavior. I expect the behavior related to neural  activity in newly grafted cells will be spontaneous and uncorrelated, but that  correlation increases as grafted cells integrate into the host neural network  and participate in behavior functions.</div>
