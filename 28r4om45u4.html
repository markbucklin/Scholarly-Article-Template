<div></div><div>Finally, the ability to directly and continuously observe the regenerative process of grafted stem cells in living animals over extended periods could offer a paradigm shift in stem cell observation which may accelerate our knowledge to develop a clinically competitive cell-based therapy. Particularly, since time-lapse imaging permits to visualize the complete development of stem cells and requires fewer animals for meaningful statistical analysis, the platform will be a powerful tool for optimizing the therapeutic efficacy and consistency without the need for rather laborious histological assessments. Most excitingly, the application in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases may reveal the reconstruction process of damaged neural circuits after transplantation, a critical course for functional restoration which remains unclear. We hope the adoption of such experimental platform will provide a time- and resource-efficient means for stem cell studies in animals leading to translational opportunities.</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 5: Conclusion</span></b></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_1">[SC1]</a>Plus silicone  gaskets??</div><div>And tube connectors?? </div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1/8”  tube connectors?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_2">[SC2]</a>Further  description of mold design and fabrication needed.</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_3">[SC3]</a>Go with the description</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_4">[SC4]</a>Intracortical?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_5">[SC5]</a>intracranial?</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_6">[SC6]</a>sealing the chamber and</div><div>    </div><div>&nbsp;<a href="#_msoanchor_7">[SC7]</a>xue, does this  make sense now?
