neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system. The
therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems
in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage.&nbsp;A number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies
for strokes and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients.
Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcomes remain highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint
which factors lead to failure or success. A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation are of crucial

is currently no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process, not to
mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Nevertheless, stem&nbsp; cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of&nbsp; development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration&nbsp; of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation.
