<div>The therapeutic potential of stem cells, due to their ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cell types and capacity for
limitless expansion, makes them a promising vehicle for repairing and replacing damaged cells in neurological diseases. Preliminary clinical trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic
relief in patients. Nevertheless, the therapeutic strategies are still at an early stage of development, and a better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation would be critical to realize clinical translation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Much of our current knowledge on transplants, however, is primarily derieved from snapshots&nbsp;</div><div></div>
