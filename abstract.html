neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system. The
therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems
in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Preliminary clinical&nbsp; trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease report that&nbsp; transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, stem&nbsp; cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of&nbsp; development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration&nbsp; of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation.
