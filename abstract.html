<div>    The therapeutic potential of stem cells, due to their ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cell types and capacity for limitless expansion, makes them a promising vehicle for repairing and replacing damaged cells in neurological diseases.&nbsp;Preliminary clinical&nbsp; trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease report that&nbsp; transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, stem&nbsp; cell therapies for neurological diseases are still at an early stage of&nbsp; development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration&nbsp; of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However.&nbsp;</div>
