<h2 data-label="764570" class="ltx_title_subsection"></h2><div>What is yet to be explored is the process hos the cells become integrated and actually function as mature cells. during development in normal/endogenous cells is characterized by recurrent spontaneous bursts along the network of cells. At first this is patterned by burst-silent-small activation then gradually transition to bust-small activation with more cells starting to fire individually. In a mature brain, replacement of network bursting with asynchronous individual cellular activity/diversification/desynchronous, which can more effectively carry information as the role of the brain. </div><div></div><div>This synchronous activity is transmitted from one cell to another through gap junctions rather than synaptic connections. At this stage during development, the immature cells are more sensitive to activation, due to heightened excitability with high membrane resistance and chloride playing a role for activation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Synchronous activity has been reported to play a critical role in normal development of cortical tissue. The activation patter is efficient to communicate for this early stages to control various aspect including, survival, migration and anatomical pattern generation.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The transition in activity correlates with the development of synaptic connections between cells. Similar activation pattern can be observed in culture cells, but does not mature into complex activation patterns, possible inferring halter development. Similar patterns were observed in human cell organoid transplanted in mouse cortex.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>It has yet been explored whether a well-characterized stem cell source has these activation properties of immature cells and able to mature into a complex network as in native developmental processes. I will explore this in this dissertation by selecting two source of stem cells.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> ·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  earlier studies … characteristic changes in  patterns of spontaneous cellular activity during cortical development </div><div>▪&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  intracellular calcium transients </div>
