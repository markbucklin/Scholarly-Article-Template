<div>Optical imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed. Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue. The ability to identify which elements of their particular  host environment are the factors driving success or disruptive factors leading  to failure will be essential towards successful integration for stem cell  therapy.&nbsp;However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large scale, and the development of such experimental platform will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can feedback towards the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div>                                  </div><blockquote><ul><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li></ul><div></div><h2>Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div><div>The integration and the therapeutic implication of grafted MGE  derived-neurons have been widely recognized over the past decade (Alvarez-Dolado  et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2014; Sebe et al., 2014).        &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="151132" class="ltx_title_section">Summary of introduction</h1><ol><li>Stem cells could do amazing things when transplanted into adults, but their challenging to work with</li><li>Other people have tried things to assess the success of their development attempts -&gt; very arduous</li><li>functional fluorescent probes like Gcamp make continous assessment possible</li><li>would work with mice, but simple cranial window approaches are insufficient for the required timeline (optical quality does not persist long enough, is unreliable, restricts phsyical access, and has initial waiting period), SO....</li><li>Chapter 3 I describe a window that meets these requirements and performance exceeds expectations</li><li>Chapter 4 I describe two proof of concept studies that use the above-mentioned device to facilitate long-term continuous imaging of calcium dynamics in two types of stem cells implanted into mouse cortex.

The ability to perform chronic imaging over the same  region will allow the migration of these cells to be traced along with any  changes in cellular activities over the maturation and integration period, with  spatio-temporal resolution.</div><div> </div><div>The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process</div>
