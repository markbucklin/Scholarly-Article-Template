<div>Optical imaging can provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Meanwhile, the technique can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals needed. Also, tracking the same cells over time is more sensitive and fail-safe than deducing temporal dynamics from snapshots of events from post-mortem tissue. The ability to identify which elements of their particular  host environment are the factors driving success or disruptive factors leading  to failure will be essential towards successful integration for stem cell  therapy.&nbsp;However, there is no prior report of in vivo imaging of transplanted stem cells  in a behaving animal nor at this large scale, and the development of such experimental platform will greatly accelerate new discoveries that can feedback towards the development of therapeutic paradigms.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
