<div>Characteristics  of spontaneous activity change progressively during cortical development. Early-form  neural activity is known to play a key role in proper cortical development  through activity-developmental processes.&nbsp;The propagation patterns and frequencies  of calcium wave carry important information to regulate neural proliferation,  differentiation, migration and connectivity. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Initially,  the network activity is dominated by a highly recurrent pattern of synchronous  network activity referred to as“network bursts.” This short burst is 0.5 - 2  seconds in duration and 0.1 - 0.5 Hz in firing rate and is followed by phases  of a silent network recovery and a low-level activity before the next  initiation. Gradually, the network activity desynchronizes and matures into  more spare and decorrelated activity, thus evolving to a network state with  better information processing capacities.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Immature  cells during development exhibit transient heightened state of plasticity, thus  increasing excitability and mediating the influx of calcium through  voltage-gated calcium channels or NMDA receptors. The collective form of  intercellular communication has been suggested to form through gap junction as  an early form preceding electrical connections via synapses, in addition to  release of signaling molecules from these cells (Malmersjo et al., 2013;  Jaderstad et al., 2010). Previous studies have shown that neural stem cells  form functional gap junctions with cells in organotypic culture as early as 2 –  18 hours after grafting. </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>During the  early phase, synapse numbers significantly increase leading to massive  overproduction of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The overproduction results  in unstructured network connectivity, which may explain the correlation of  prolonged burst duration with increased synapse density. In the subsequent  phase, this number declines with synaptic pruning to accommodate the balance&nbsp;between  excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Both firing rate and burst duration  decrease, and network bursts exhibit diversification of activity with richer  patterns. Yet in isolated development, the characteristic synchronized burst  activity patterns that normally extend only a few days in vivo persist  throughout the lifetime in cultured neurons, which may suggest an arrest in  development.&nbsp;Similar persistence of bursting was also observed in human  organoid implant in mouse cortex.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The evolution  of the activity pattern during normal cortical development can be followed  using a variety of methods. Periodic electrophysiological recording using  multi-electrode arrays (MEA) and acute optical recording of intracellular  calcium transients provide a convenient method to record simultaneous activity  in multiple neurons in vitro and ex vivo. Yet, the progression of observed  synchronized burst patterns activity behavior as implanted stem cell integrate  with a host has never been observed. And whether transplants&nbsp;exhibit  comparative developmental changes during maturation and integration and whether  such developmental characteristics are important for integration remain to be  determined. This feature may yield a new biomarker for evaluating functional integration  of transplanted stem cells in vivo.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>electrophysiology: extracellular, patch-clamp, grid</li><li>fluorescence microscopy: slice, immuno-fluorescent probes/dyes, etc.</li></ul><div></div>
