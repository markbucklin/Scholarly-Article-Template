<div>The two-stage cranial implant devices described here were developed  to enable reliable long-term optical access and intermittent physical access to  mouse neocortex. Our particular application required bilateral cortical windows  compatible with wide-field imaging through a fluorescence microscope, and  physical access to the underlying tissue for virus-mediated gene delivery and  injection of exogenous labeled cells. Optical access was required as soon as  possible post-installation, and to be sustained for several months. The design  focused on addressing the issue common to other window designs meant for  rodents: progressive degradation of the optical light-path at the  brain-to-window interface caused by highly scattering tissue growth. The optical  insert is molded to fit the chamber and craniotomy, blocking tissue growth and  providing a reliable optical interface for up to one year. Additionally, the  core design can be rapidly adapted to improve performance or for varying  applications.</div><div></div><h2 data-label="626472" class="ltx_title_subsection">Critical Elements</h2><div>In assessing the design presented here, we can point to a  few critical elements that facilitate the maintenance of the long-term optical  quality. Refer to the methods section for the specifics of surgical procedures  for headplate attachment and optical insert installation. These procedures were  established after testing the variable formulations in protocol.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>First, the design of the optical insert must incorporate a  mechanical barrier that fits along the edges of the craniotomy. The barrier  must be continuous along the circumference, and extend as far as the inside  surface of the skull to be effective.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Achieving this tight fit without aggressively impinging on  the brain requires some sort of fine height adjustment capability. The optical insert  must be installed at the correct height during the installation procedure, or  shortly thereafter. The insert must be depressed very slightly until full  contact is made across the entire window, but pressing beyond necessary will  quickly exert an undesired increase in intracranial pressure, increasing  inflammation and adverse outcomes. The mechanism for fine adjustment can be  designed into the system, as is demonstrated in the second design presented  here, or incorporated into the installation procedure, as is done in the first  design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Of particular note, we found that administration of  antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs in the days surrounding any major  surgical procedure had a substantial impact on the viability of the optical  interface. We used both corticosteroid and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory  drugs, and attempts to exclude either ended poorly more often than not (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Equally critical to the long-term health of the imaging  chamber was the requirement to establish and maintain an air-tight seal between  the chamber and the outside world. This includes a permanent bond between the  chamber and skull, and a reversible bond between the chamber rim and optical  insert. How this is accomplished will be specific to the system design, but it  is absolutely essential.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In addition to establishing and maintaining an air-tight  seal, it is necessary to eliminate any and all pockets of air within the  chamber. Any air pockets that remain after installation will be susceptible to  bacteria growth and may disrupt normal intracranial and intermembrane  pressures. The system presented here used sterile agarose fill to displace all  air within the chamber prior to sealing. Dead space surrounding the optical insert,  including that temporarily filled with agarose, will fill with fluid and  eventually be overtaken by granulation tissue. This process is helpful to the  maintenance of a aseptic chamber environment, so care should be taken not to  disrupt it. However, an excess of dead space will delay this process, and thus  should be minimized when adapting the design.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Many attempts to test variations from the described  procedures indicated that all elements mentioned above are equally critical to  achieving a reliable imaging window with sustained optical quality.  Implementing the procedures as described or something similar should mitigate  the primary obstacle to long-term imaging in mice and other rodents. The need  to pre-terminate imaging experiments due to optical light-path disruption by  tissue ingrowth should be substantially reduced. This capability will  drastically reduce wasted time and resources for experiments of any duration,  and will facilitate previously infeasible studies requiring long-term  observation such as for research in aging or the progression chronic neurological  disorders.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="651583" class="ltx_title_subsection">Staging Implant Installation &amp; Tissue Access</h2><div>Configuring the implant as described, so as to enable a  staged installation of multiple parts enables surgical procedures to be spread  across multiple days. This capability offers a number of advantages. It may  save time and resources -- particularly during the prototype stages -- by  allowing time to ensure each implanted mouse fully recovers from the initial  procedure. Additionally, the delay between surgeries allows the heightened  inflammation and other immune system response triggered by craniotomy to  normalize before attempting a tissue intervention that is sensitive to these  conditions (e.g. viral or cell injections) (ref). Through this mechanism the  system offers the capability to image the first tissue intervention from day 0.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similarly, designing the system to be installable in  multiple stages enables trivial and repeatable tissue access at later time  points by simple reversal of procedure for optical insert installation. The  process may be comparable to a previously reported method of removing the  entire glass window to access the tissue (ref). With this system, however, the  methods used to remove and replace are faster and simpler and carry less risk  of tissue damage compared. Additionally, the described methods of facilitating  tissue access can be advantageous over a fixed access port by providing full  access without compromising the image field (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="415096" class="ltx_title_subsection">Design Adaptation</h2><div>While the specific designs described in this report have  much to offer, the greatest asset of the underlying system is its easy  adaptability. The design can be rapidly transformed to accommodate various  applications or to modify its performance in response to new technologies and  demands. This rapid adaptability was a primary goal of this project, and  informed our design and engineering decisions throughout development. Anyone  with access to common laboratory equipment and moderate engineering and  fabrication skills can produce a system to fit their particular needs. As an inherent  aspect of any design process, the adaptation of the original design evolved  over the course of prototyping and testing. In presenting two designs in this  report, our intention was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of  continuous development of a future-proof system. The original system was  adapted to accommodate the continuous evolution of image sensor technology,  particularly the growth in size and resolution, expanding the field of view and  allowing simultaneous access to cellular interactions across multiple brain  regions using wide-field imaging (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The iterative process used here was only made possible by  using the now widely available rapid prototyping procedures, 3D-printing and  laser-cutting -- major progress of manufacturing and its increased versatility,  providing better quality, customization, lower cost and shorter production time  (ref). In an effort to compare various manufacturing technologies, we explored  manufacturing the finalized product design through a number of companies and  advanced with 3D metal printing with overall satisfaction at i.materialise --  we had also developed the parts through other rapid prototyping companies  including Shapeways and Sculpteo.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="322223" class="ltx_title_subsection">Future Improvements</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="147941" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conclusion</h2><div></div><div></div>
