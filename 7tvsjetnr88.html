Prototypes  were fabricated using CamBam to generate toolpaths in G-code for machining on a  CNC mill. The headplate and window frame were milled from aluminum plate. The  mold for casting PDMS-based windows was designed in <a>three parts</a><a href="#_msocom_1">[SC1]</a>&nbsp;. The middle component was milled from PTFE. <a>The outer components were made using a  laser-cutter and acrylic sheet (Supplementary). </a><a href="#_msocom_2">[SC2]</a>&nbsp;CAD files are shared on XXXXX(github?)XXXXX. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="162333" class="ltx_title_section"> Window casting procedure</h1><div>The PDMS-based windows were fabricated through vacuum casting  procedure. Prior to casting, window frames and two glass coverslips (Corning,  2947-75x38), prepared in advance through plasma etching (30 sec, Power setting) and  silanization using Trichlorosilane (Sigma-Aldrich, 448931-10G), were inserted into  the mold. The mold was then placed between two custom-made acrylic plates with  silicone gaskets in between and was assembled using bolts around the <a>perimeter</a><a href="#_msocom_3">[SC3]</a>&nbsp;. The pressure control port (McMaster-Carr, 5454K61) was connected to  the house vacuum line, and the fill port (McMaster-Carr, 2844K11) was connected  to uncured PDMS polymer (Dow Corning Sylgard 184) (1:10 by weight), thoroughly  mixed and degassed in advance. The liquid-state polymer was then drawn into the  mold filling the volume in between the two coverslips using vacuum. Once  polymer displaced all air, vacuum was released and positive pressure was  applied through the pressure control port after plugging the fill port. While  maintaining positive pressure, the polymer was cured at 75ºC for 12 hours.  Finally, the windows were released from the mold and trimmed using scalpels.  Windows were handled so as to protect the top and bottom surfaces from damage  or debris. The completed window was sterilized in an autoclave before use. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="994187" class="ltx_title_section">Experiment timeline</h1><div>The experimental timeline was referenced to the day of cell transplantation, 0 day-after-transplantation (DAT). Surgeries were performed two days in advance, and imaging sessions started from 5 DAT until the optical clarity lasted, in some cases extending upto 250 DAT.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="138646" class="ltx_title_section"> Surgical procedures</h1><div>Animal care for surgical procedures is  described below, and the details specific to each procedure are in the sections  that follow. All procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and  Use at Boston University. Stereotaxic surgeries were performed on 6 to 8 weeks  old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories). Pre-operative care for  the initial headplate and craniotomy procedure included subcutaneous  administration of meloxicam (NSAID, 2.5 ug/g) and buprenorphine (opioid  analgesics, 0.3 ug/g), and intramuscular injection of dexamethasone  (corticosteroid, 5 ug/g) one hour before surgery. Meloxicam and buprenorphine  were continued postoperatively every 12 hours for 48 hours. Meloxicam was also  given before and after procedures where brain tissue was exposed, i.e. those  for <a>intracerebral</a><a href="#_msocom_4">[SC4]</a>&nbsp;<a href="#_msocom_5">[SC5]</a>&nbsp; injection and window replacement. For all procedures described below,  mice were placed under general anesthesia with isoflurane mixed with oxygen.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="720017" class="ltx_title_section"> Headplate installation and  craniotomy</h1><div>We shaved the top of the mouse’s head and sterilized the skin using 70%  alcohol and 7.5% Betadine. We made a 1cm midline sagittal incision through the  scalp using surgical scissors, and retracted laterally using a self-retaining  retractor (WPI, 501968). To prepare the cranial surface, we applied 3% hydrogen  peroxide to oxidize and facilitate removal of periosteal tissue with cotton tip  swabs. The surface was then marked up before headplate installation followed by  craniotomy. We targeted laterally symmetric craniotomies with edge length 2.2  mm centered at coordinates ±1.83 mm lateral to sagittal suture and 1.00 mm  anterior to bregma. First, we used a surgical skin marker (FST, 18000-30) to  roughly indicate the site of each craniotomy and enhance contrast of the edges  to be etched. We etched the corners and edges using a dental drill with a FG  1/4 round carbide burr (Fig. 2 Step 1(L)). This way of marking the edges  facilitates headplate placement and also aids recovery of the intended  craniotomy position despite being covered by semi-transparent adhesive cement  in the following steps.</div><div>We used a custom stereotaxic attachment (Supplementary) to position the headplate  symmetrically aligned with the marked sites, and to hold it horizontal while  bonding to skull. The headplate was anchored directly to the skull using either  opaque or semi-clear quick adhesive cement (Parkell, S380). Subsequently, we  began each craniotomy by drilling along the marked edges (Fig. 2 Step 2(L)). We  frequently stopped to flush debris from the site using sterile saline and an  aspirator. Once separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was  carefully removed using a pair of sharp forceps (FST, 91150-20) and a 45º micro  probe (FST, 10066-15) while keeping the dura intact (Fig. 2 Step 1(R)). At this  point, we either attached the optical window or sealed the area with a layer of  non-toxic silicone adhesive (WPI, KWIK-SIL). </div><div></div><h1 data-label="139073" class="ltx_title_section"> Optical insert attachment</h1><div>The optical insert attachment can be performed immediately following  the craniotomy or deferred to the day of injection as described below (Fig. 2  Step 4). First, we filled the headplate chamber with sterile 0.5% agarose  solution, immersing the exposed brain. Enough agarose was added so as to  overflow the walls of the chamber as the window is inserted, ensuring no air  gaps remain in the space between the walls of the chamber and the window, below  the joint to be sealed. Next, the window was placed in the chamber, directly  over the craniotomy, in gentle contact with the exposed tissue. We used a ttaxic  apparatus to adjust the window height and secure its position during  attachment. This was aided by an attachment – similar to that used for  headplate installation – which fixed the angle of the window’s top surface  parallel with that of the headplate. The height adjustment required depressing  the window until full contact was observed between the inner window surface and  the dura. The window was tacked in place by applying an accelerated light-cured  composite (Pentron Clinic, Flow-It ALC) in at least three points, bonding the  window frame to the anterior and posterior walls of the headplate. At this  point the guide was removed and the joint was prepped for sealing. Excess  agarose (polymerized overflow from the window insertion step) was aspirated  away to expose and clean the headplate surface surrounding the window. The  chamber was sealed by filling the joint between headplate and optical insert  with dental cement (Stoelting, 51458) using a P200 pipette. The window surface  was protected by applying a double layer adhesive strip made of gaffers tape  over a transparent adhesive film dressing (3M: Tegaderm, 70200749201).</div><div></div><h1 data-label="669050" class="ltx_title_section"> Window detachment and replacement</h1><div>The dental cement<a> </a><a href="#_msocom_6">[SC6]</a>&nbsp;connecting the window and headplate was etched away using a dental  drill. Before removing the window, we thoroughly flushed debris from the  surrounding surfaces with sterile saline. <a>Replacement windows were installed using the  same procedures described above for initial attachment. Localizing the  replacement window to the same position was aided by the expansion of  granulation tissue up to the walls of the prior window.</a><a href="#_msocom_7">[SC7]</a>&nbsp; </div><div></div><h1 data-label="110068" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-font-green" data-font-color="true">Animal surgery, virus injection, and stem cell transplantation</span></h1><div>All surgical procedures followed the Boston University IACUC protocol. Surgeries are performed on 6 to 8 weeks old female C57/BL6 mice as the recipients for progenitor cell transplantation. One hour prior to the surgery, dexamethasone (5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary, 07-808-8194) was administered by intramuscular injection to relieve any tissue inflammatory response and to prevent cerebral edema. The mouse was placed under general anesthesia with 1 - 1.5% isoflurane mixed with oxygen. As pre-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-845-6986) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, Patterson Veterinary; 07-891-9756) were administered subcutaneously (SC) to reduce pain and inflammatory responses. The mouse was immobilized on a stereotaxic. The incision area was sterilized using 70% alcohol and XX, then a cut was made along the midline of the brain. The skin was retracted apart laterally using surgical clamps (XX), and 3% H2O2 was applied to remove the periosteum of the skull. Four corners of a square craniotomy over motor cortex with edges of 2.2 mm and center coordinates of 1.83 lateral and 1.00 anterior was lightly etched using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. The etched points were marked over with surgical skin marker (XX), then the edges were etched along the four corners using a dental drill. The marking procedure was necessary to enhance the contrast of the etched areas for accurate placement of the headplate under the semi-transparent dental cement in the step to follow. Utilizing a custom made surgical guide fixed onto the stereotaxic that will hold the headplate horizontal to the plane, the headplate was positioned roughly over the centers between the intended craniotomy regions of both hemispheres and anchored directly onto the skull using C&amp;B Metabond. Once the Metabond hardened, the surgical guide was removed and the excess bone cement covering the etched area was drilled away. Once the skull was exposed, it was cleaned of any debris by irrigating with sterile saline. Subsequently, 2.2 x 2.2 mm2 craniotomy was performed on one or both sides of the hemisphere along the previously marked area using dental drill with a FG4 carbide. Constant flow of sterile saline and and aspirator was used to cool down the brain and to flush out any debris. Once the skull within the craniotomy was separated from the surrounding skull, the bone flap was carefully removed using a pair of XX forceps (XX) and a Bonn microprobe (XX) while keeping the dura intact without any damage. Sterile saline was used to further clean up the area, and the exposed brain area was sealed using KwikSil (XX). The mouse was then moved for recovery, and for post-operative care, meloxicam (2.5 ug/g, SC) and buprenorphine (0.3 ug/g, SC) were administered over 48 hour period to reduce inflammation and pain. </div><div>Prior to injection or cell transplantation, the KwikSil plug covering over the craniotomy was carefully removed from the edges to avoid any capillary rupture below the dura due to the negative pressure created by the seal. The brain was flushed several times with sterile saline before and after the injection procedure. Injections were performed using glass pipettes with an outer tip diameter of 40 – 80 um on Nanofil controlled by MicroXX. The pipette was back-filled with mineral oil then front-loaded with virus or cells. In general, an injection of 230 nL of cells at 10^6 cells/uL or 200 nL of virus (titer) was performed ~ 500 um into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min on each hemisphere. The micropipette was let to sit additional 2 min at the injection site to prevent any overflowing then was withdrawn slowly. </div><div>Once the injection was completed, sterile 0.5% agarose was used to fill in any air gaps over the exposed brain tissue, and the polymer-based window was placed directly on top of the dura over the craniotomy. Using a custom made guide, the window was held parallel to the headplate and pushed down to compensate for the removed skull thickness. Once the height was adjusted, UV curable dental cement (XX) was used to quickly fix the window in place on the headplate. The guide was moved out of the way, and any agarose that overflow from the window insertion was aspirated out once it polymerized. Dental cement (XX) was then used to seal the rest of the junction between the headplate and the window ensuring air tight seal between the two parts. Gaffers tape on top of wound sealing tape (XX) was used to protect the polymer window from any scratches. Meloxicam (2.5 ug/g) was given every 24 hours over the next 72 hours to reduce any inflammation due to the installation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="623659" class="ltx_title_section"><span class="au-font-green" data-font-color="true">Progenitor cell harvest and labeling </span></h1><div>The progenitor cells from cortex and ganglionic eminence were both harvested from E13.5 CD-1 mouse embryos (Charles River). The detailed dissection procedures can be found in prior papers (REF). Briefly, the two hemispheres were separated from the brain stem. The cortical progenitor cells were collected from the dorsal and lateral regions of the cerebral cortex. Then, the interneuron progenitor cells from medial and lateral ganglionic eminence were dissected from the basal forebrain in which the sulcus separating the tissue is evident. Once the tissues were dissected, the tissue chunks were let to sit in the dissociation medium, 100 ug/mL of DNaseI in DMEM, at 37 for 10 min, and subsequently mechanical dissociated by gently pipetting up and down using a P200 pipette. The dissociated cells were let to sit another 2 min, and the supernatant was transferred and spun at 270 g for 10 min. The medium was removed as much as possible, and the cell pellet was dissociated in 50 uL of NB/B27 medium and 2 uL of AAV9-Cag-GCaMP6f (titer) was added to the medium. During the 30 mins of incubation period at 37 °C for transduction, the cell suspension was pipetted gently every 10 min to keep the cells dissociated. Following the transduction, three washing steps were performed to remove any excess virus in the supernatant. First, 7 mL of DMEM was added to the mixture of cells and virus then centrifuged at 270 g for 10 min. Once the pellet was formed, the medium was removed and the previous step was repeated twice more. The cell pellet was then washed with 1 mL of DMEM then was resuspended at the concentration of 10^6 cells/ uL in NB/B27 and kept in ice until transplantation.</div><div></div><h1 data-label="726204" class="ltx_title_section"> Injection</h1><div><a href="#_msocom_8">[SC8]</a>&nbsp;The exposed brain was flushed with sterile saline before and after each  injection. Injections were made using pulled glass micropipettes with inner tip  diameter ranging from 40 and 80 um (WPI, 504949). The micropipette was  initially back-filled with mineral oil, then secured onto a microprocessor  controlled injector (WPI, NANOLITER2010). The micropipette was then  front-loaded with virus or cells using a controller (WPI, Sys-Micro4). In  general, an injection of 230 nL of cells labeled with AAV9.CAG.GCaMP6f  (AV-9-PV3081, Penn Vector Core) at 106 cells/uL, or 230 nL of  AAV9.Syn.GCaMP6f (AV-9-PV2822, Penn Vector Core). Injection was performed  approximately 500 um deep into the cortex at the rate of 46 nL/min near the  center of the imaging field, while avoiding blood vessels to maximize the  observable cells around the injection site (Fig. 2 Step 3). The micropipette  was left to sit for an additional 2 min at the injection site before slow  withdrawal. </div><div></div><h1 data-label="391757" class="ltx_title_section"> Wide-field in vivo imaging and  microscope setup</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging was  accomplished using a custom microscope equipped with a sCMOS camera (Hamamatsu,  ORCA Flash 4.0XX), 470 nm LED (Thorlabs, M470L3), excitation and emission  filters of XX and XX, a dichroic mirror (XX), and a 10x objective lens  (Mitutoyo, 378-803-3). Mice were positioned under the microscope for imaging  using a custom headplate holder (Supplementary) and allowed to run on an air-supported spherical  treadmill18 as pictured in Figure 2 Step 5. The camera recorded a field-of-view of  approximately 1.3 mm x 1.3 mm using an image resolution of 2048 x 2048 or more  commonly 1024 x 1024. Continuous image sequences were acquired at 40 to 60 frames-per-second  for 5 to 7 minutes. We selected the field to image within each site by roughly  centering around the injection site. To focus the microscope on labeled cells  in the superficial layers of cortex, we focused on the surface vasculature to  find a stable reference, then advanced the focal plane 50 to 150 <a>um until  multiple cells were distinguishable</a><a href="#_msocom_9">[SC9]</a>&nbsp;. A reference image of the selected image was recorded for each site  and used later to reacquire the same field across image sessions. Alignment to  this reference image relied primarily on using the major blood vessels as  landmarks to guide microscope position in the XY plane. Image sequences were  stored for subsequent processing and analysis.</div><div></div><h1>Immunohistochemistry</h1><div>Brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde by perfusion, embedded in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound then sectioned coronally at 40 um using a Cryostat. Free-floating sections were immune-stained with chicken anti-GFP (1:250) and rabbit anti-GABA (1:1000). Confocal images were taken using scanning confocal microscope in Micro/Nano Imaging Facility in the Biomedical Engineering department.    </div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 3: Cranial window</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="728874" class="ltx_title_section">Introduction</h1><div>Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living  brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput  detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to  capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet  optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation  of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for  high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited  due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access  window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical  scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution. </div><div></div><div>Efforts to overcome  this problem by adding purely mechanical features to the cranial window have  involved attaching spacers made of agarose11,17, silicone18,19  and glass7 to the window’s brain-facing surface that compensate for  the thickness of removed bone. These approaches report delaying tissue regrowth  for up to a few months before optical quality deteriorates. These modest  results indicate a valid basis underlying this approach and suggest that  extending this strategy by starting with a design and material not limited by the  fixed form of flat glass optical windows could yield some improvement.  Additional elements of a chronic cranial imaging window intended to mitigate  degradation by granulation tissue typically target inflammation, the primary  source stimulating the process. These include the aseptic design of seals and  features, selective use of biocompatible materials, and perioperative  administration of anti-inflammatory and antibiotic drugs7,20,21.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>While these designs  have improved longevity, they remain limited in terms of long-term access to  the cortical tissue. The ability to access and manipulate tissue during  real-time imaging opens the door in experimental designs to an expansive  toolbox of neuromanipulation possibilities allowing exploration of uncharted  connectivity and dynamic processes of the brain22. Several  strategies have been reported to gain access to regions below glass cranial  windows by incorporating features such as an access port sealed with elastomer23,  infusion cannula24, or the use of microfluidic channels17.  Nonetheless, the approaches limit the tissue accessibility to a single  designated site predetermined before an experiment begins and do not offer  uniform access over the imaging area.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>To address the  relative restrictions using glass as cranial windows, a number of alternative  approaches have highlighted the use of silicone elastomer for cranial windows25–29. For example, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)  is optically clear, non-toxic and chemically inert and can be molded to take  any shape or exhibit any desired feature, not necessarily sacrificing the  imaging field of the window. These properties combine to offer a remarkably  versatile material, particularly favorable for prototype development for  projects with demanding specifications for biocompatibility and optical  performance. A well-known and widely used example is the artificial dura for in  vivo optical imaging in nonhuman primates25,26,30. This chronic implant device is placed in  and covers a craniotomy and sits protected within a chronic cranial recording  chamber. It mitigates tissue regrowth, and interfaces with a cylindrical insert  – also made of PDMS – for optical imaging of neocortex. Additionally, the  artificial dura is thin enough to enable access to underlying tissue for  penetrating electrodes, which penetrate easily and leave a tight seal after  withdrawal. Yet the efforts for translating this design windows for small  research animals using silicone elastomer have thus far been limited (ref). And  a system with long-lasting optical quality and flexible tissue accessibility  remains to be developed or explored for rodent models. </div><div></div><div>In this paper, we  describe a design and demonstrate a two-stage cranial implant device, developed  to facilitate longitudinal imaging experiments in mouse neocortex. The primary  capability requirements for this design are: </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long-term  stability of an optically clear light-path to cortical surface</div><div>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intermittent  physical access to imaged region at any point in study </div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The system was  designed considering biocompatibility and optical performance to facilitate  integration in place of the removed bone flap enabling us to achieve sustained  periods of optical quality, extending beyond a year in some mice and allowing  high spatiotemporal resolution using a wide-field microscope. Additionally, the  two-part system consisting of a fixed headplate with integrated neural access  chamber and optical insert, allowed flexible access to the underlying tissue.  The utility of our design is demonstrated through chronic optical imaging of  calcium dynamics in the cortex and acute interventions to the tissue upon  removal and replacement of the cranial window from the headplate. Finally, we demonstrate the technical feasibility  of rapid adaptation of the system that can accommodate varying applications,  further extending our ability to visualize and access neural tissue. </div>
