<h2 data-label="546756" class="ltx_title_subsection">Functional integration</h2><div>Lastly, we wanted to use the platform to understand what these cells are doing in the host brain and whether the functionality can be observed through host recipient behavior. The cells were transplanted in the motor cortex, and the various motor behaviors were monitored to have a comprehensive aspect of what is happening in the brain in correlation with the motor function as the mouse was fully awake and freely moving on a treadmill, and we monitor using camera and mouse sensor simultaneously. In the passive experiment, where we observed the mouse running behavior to brain function, didnâ€™t see much change. This was the same case in the local cell population. In addition, we observed the brain function after actively stimulating with light to direct the mouse movement. In this experiment, we used light as the mouse tend to move away from the light then shown from behind. We binned the brain activity pre- and post-stimulation to light, and the brain activity was measured to see whether there is a change in function directly related to the light. We observed that upon light shining from the left, the mouse ran towards and right and vice versa. Additionally, the mouse tail oriented towards the movement direction, and the whisker movement increased, and the pupil dilation increased during the stimulation. We observed the there is a observable change in mouse behavior due to light guiding. In the brain, we observed the information being conducted in the brain during the stimulation moment by measuring the compressibility and comparing before and after. We observed that the compressibility decreases post-stimulation by XX indicating the the cellular dynamics are directly working towards the function demonstrated in motions. This was consistent but with less degree compared to the local cell population. As the network got more complicated, the correlation increased as well indicating that the cells are integrating into the local neural network and also functionally participating into the functions. The demonstration shows that the experimental platform can be used to examine the integration extension by measuring the complexity of the network formed as well as how much of this is functional by comparing with the behavior and optically observe the functional integration of grafted stem cells from different sources.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div>
