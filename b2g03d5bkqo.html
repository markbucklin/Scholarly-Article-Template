<div>While neuronal replacement involves complex dynamics  of cellular interactions over weeks to establish connections with host neural  circuits, the regenerative process remains largely unknown. In order to develop stem cell-based therapeutics that would lead to  functional restoration in the brain, the technical ability for continuous  observation with high temporal and spatial resolution would be important for  comprehensive understanding of the biological processes.        </div>
