<div></div><h1 data-label="340468" class="ltx_title_section">New technology for optical imaging empowers researchers with chronic in vivo observation capability</h1><div>                                  Technical advances  in the tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate complex neural networks in real time. This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. Such technique can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and on interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution.&nbsp;Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Similar experimental approaches have been pursued since to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Additionally, functional imaging strategies can be combined to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input in anesthetized animals. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds. Consequently, the scope of these studies were limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells. Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and distribute long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2>Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h2><div>       Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those preciously available in science-grade cameras. Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last decade, this combination of developments have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which have undoubtedly strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div> </div><div>Scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable of recording continuous activity of greater than one thousand neurons in a behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional epifluorescence microscopy. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may provide better insights into neural coding. </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="593217" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse neocortex</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="496162" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the key  advantages of in vivo imaging regards the ability to observe and record from  the same brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes.  This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div> </div><h2 data-label="186920" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term Continuous imaging study to follow grafted stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><div>The prospect of monitoring regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells within larger multicellular networks in vivo is now practical is now practical and possible using the imaging techniques described above.&nbsp;Individual cells can be followed throughout the course of integration to perform longitudinal comparisons of viability, distribution, differentiation as well as cellular and network activity from each animal. This experimental approach can substantially reduce the number of experimental animals eliminate the frustration in number of aniamls needed for&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Thus, optical imaging should provide an alternative and complementary approach to evaluation of survival, migration and differentiation status&nbsp;which previously relied heavily on histological analyses. Furthermore, such new types of measurements may also offer a better reflection of timing and extent at which transplanted cells are functionally integrated into existing neural networks.&nbsp;Yet such experiments have not been pursued thus far.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>    but the use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications to reveal novel aspects of the process that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.    </div>
