This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. </div><div></div><div>Meanwhile, image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras. This advances   in digital imaging technology combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for recording neural activity in vivo over the last decade.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>enable the use of conventional    epifluorescence microscopy techniques to visualize neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution.&nbsp;    Increasing fraction of observable neurons within the larger context of multicellular networks may provide better insights into neural coding across wide areas of the brain.

Additionally, continual imaging over a region will  give us the ability to track the stem cells along with their change in cellular  activities upon transplantation in which temporal and spatial information is  simultaneously acquired.         </div><div></div><div></div><div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in  living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various  labeling strategies and imaging modalities. </div><div></div><div></div><div>Technical advances in tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes in real time have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate the complex neural network.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Meanwhile, the iterative improvements of Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) allow to detect neural activation with increasingly high fidelity. </div>
