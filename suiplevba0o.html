This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volume scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging by minimizing the scattering and diffusion of light within the brain. Such technique yields three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and the interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution.&nbsp;Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Similar experimental approaches have been pursued since to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals. </div><div></div><div>Additionally, functional imaging strategies can be combined to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies mentioned above, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input. However, the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds</div><div></div><div></div><div>. Thus, such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, whereas transplanted cells are highly migratory and often disperse long distance from their site of transplantation.&nbsp; </div><div></div><div>Meanwhile, image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras. This advances over the last decade in digital imaging technology, combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for functional imaging in vivo at a much larger scale than that was attainable previously. Using a conventional epifluorescence microscopy techniques with a scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) camera, we are able to record neural activity from&nbsp;hundreds to thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution. Increasing fraction of observable neurons may provide better insights into neural coding, or may lead a better understanding of neural function of transplanted cells within larger multicellular networks. Yet such experiments have not been pursued thus far.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>       </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="488593" class="ltx_title_section">Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h1><div>what we are doing&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>    </div><div></div><div>Long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells.    </div>
