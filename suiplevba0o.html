This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volume scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging by minimal light scattering and diffusion within the brain. Such technique yields three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and the interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution.&nbsp;Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Similar experimental approaches have been pursued since to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Additionally, functional imaging strategies can be combined to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input. Yet such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds. The scope of these studies were limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells. Meanwhile, transplanted cells are often highly migratory and disperse long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>       Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those preciously available in science-gradr</div><div></div><div></div><div>Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras. And, the latest generation of genetically encoded calcium sensors deliver a substantial boost in signal strength. This breakthrough in signal strength is manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity, which will undoubtedly strengthen our competence to conduct brain research. This advances over the last decade in digital imaging technology, combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for functional imaging in vivo at a much larger scale than that was attainable previously. </div>
