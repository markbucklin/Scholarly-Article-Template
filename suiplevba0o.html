This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins.

This advances over the last decade in digital imaging technology, combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for functional imaging in vivo at a much larger scale than that was attainable previously using multi-photon microscopy. Using a conventional epifluorescence microscopy techniques with a scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) camera, we are able to record neural activity from&nbsp;hundreds to thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution. Increasing fraction of observable neurons  may provide better insights into neural coding     within the larger context of multicellular networks.

Calcium imaging of stem cell grafts may be a powerful tool for a more  thorough assessment of their functional connection into the neural network,  through large-scale imaging of the population.    Long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells.</div><div></div><div>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="593217" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse neocortex</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="496162" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the key  advantages of in vivo imaging regards the ability to observe and record from  the same brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes.  This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div> </div><h2 data-label="546663" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term Continuous imaging study to follow grafted stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><ul><li>We want to measure the things mentioned above that indicate a successful transplant (in-vivo)</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>survival</li><li>migration</li><li>differentiation</li><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li><li>what we expect the dynamics to be like</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div>In this section, I  propose to integrate the transplantation procedure of MGE cells with the  imaging system developed in the previous section to monitor the functional  integration of the grafted cells using chronic imaging over the same area. By  labeling stem cells with GECI, the imaging technique will allow a more thorough  assessment of the functional connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain,  whereas electrophysiology is restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or  two target regions. The utility of the platform will be  tested by performing periodic structural and dynamic imaging procedures to  track the development of grafted stem cells as they migrate through host cortex  and functionally integrate with host neural network. Migration of cells and  changes in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning  procedure with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across  sessions. Additionally,  continual imaging over a region will give us the ability to track the stem  cells along with their change in cellular activities upon transplantation in  which temporal and spatial information is simultaneously acquired. I will also  record the running behavior of the mice utilizing a ball treadmill on which the  mouse can run freely during the imaging sessions. Additionally, we can use  information theory to produce measurements of neural activity as it relates to  behavior. Specifically, mutual information (i.e. cross-correlation) between  network activity and behavior (movement) can be calculated in which the measure  indicates the functional integration of cells in the host neural network  presumably responsible for corresponding behavior. </div>
