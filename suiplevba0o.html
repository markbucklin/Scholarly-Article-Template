This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volumetric scanning using two-photon microscopy allows deep penetration imaging with minimal light scattering and diffusion inside the brain. Such technique can yield three-dimensional morphological information at cellular and subcellular resolutions and on interactions between cells in their native context. Its large-volume imaging capacity also enables to visualize anatomical organization of neural network with excellent spatial resolution.&nbsp;Falckner et al. were first to report the use the technique to track the regenerative processes of transplanted stem cells. Similar experimental approaches have been pursued since to elucidate the dynamics of morphological integration and the synaptic reinnervation of transplanted cells in living animals.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Additionally, functional imaging strategies can be combined to monitor neural activity that should allow a more integrative assessment of graft-to-host connectivity. In the same studies, calcium imaging of transplanted cells suggested evidence for functional afferent inputs from host neurons in response to sensory input. However, such tools may be insufficient to investigate cellular activity within large tissue volumes, and the microscopes' field of view and/or spatial resolution need to be reduced to achieve high temporal resolution on a time scale of miliseconds. Consequently, the scope of these studies were limited to simultaneous recording from a small number of cells. Yet transplanted cells are often highly migratory and disperse long distance from their site of transplantation, and an alternative imaging modality may be appropriate for such applications.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>       Image sensors available in scientific cameras are now larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those preciously available in science-grade cameras. Meanwhile, the latest generation of GECIs deliver a substantial boost in signal strength, manifested by a considerable increase in the spatial and temporal resolution we may use to detect and record neural activity. Over the last decade, this combination of developments have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for wide-field functional imaging, which have undoubtedly strengthened our competence to conduct brain research.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div> </div><h1 data-label="488593" class="ltx_title_section">Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h1><div>Scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) cameras in particular have enabled optical imaging of neural networks at a much larger scale than what was previously attainable. We are now capable of recording continuous activity of greater than one thousand neurons in a behaving mouse for hours at a time over several weeks using a traditional epifluorescence microscopy.

Long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells.     Yet such experiments have not been pursued thus far.&nbsp;            </div><div></div><div>high temporal and spatial resolution</div><div></div><div>at single-cell resolution. </div><div></div><div>what we are doing&nbsp;</div><div></div><div><span>By measuring the simultaneous activity in multiple neurons we can identify patterns describing quantifiable relationships between cells in a network. A typical behavioral neuroscience experiment will also synchronize the acquisition of neural activity signals with recordings representing some aspect of the external environment, i.e. a stimulus presented to the animal or the behavior observed. By applying a variable set of comparison operations across the network and over time we can infer the existence of repeatable patterns associating the activity of the brain with its external environment. For example, by recording the activity in two neurons in a mouse we might find that one of the neurons tends to increase activity directly following the tone, and that the other neuron tends to increase activity just before the first neuron returns back to a normal baseline.</span></div><div>    </div><div>This – combined with equally critical advances in the size, speed, and sensitivity of image sensors available in scientific cameras – enables high-throughput detection of neural activity in behaving animals using traditional wide-field fluorescence microscopy.  &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>   As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment.   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div>Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. </div><div></div><div>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. </div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="593217" class="ltx_title_section">Cranial window implants for mouse neocortex</h1><div></div><h2 data-label="496162" class="ltx_title_subsection">Challenge of maintaining long-term optical quality</h2><div>One of the key  advantages of in vivo imaging regards the ability to observe and record from  the same brain region for extended periods to track long-term changes.  This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div> </div><h2 data-label="546663" class="ltx_title_subsection">Long-term Continuous imaging study to follow grafted stem-cell integration in mouse cortex</h2><ul><li>We want to measure the things mentioned above that indicate a successful transplant (in-vivo)</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>survival</li><li>migration</li><li>differentiation</li><li>connection (and consequently behavior)</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>how long term</li><li>how often we measure</li><li>what we expect the dynamics to be like</li></ul><div></div><div></div><div>In this section, I  propose to integrate the transplantation procedure of MGE cells with the  imaging system developed in the previous section to monitor the functional  integration of the grafted cells using chronic imaging over the same area. By  labeling stem cells with GECI, the imaging technique will allow a more thorough  assessment of the functional connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain,  whereas electrophysiology is restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or  two target regions. The utility of the platform will be  tested by performing periodic structural and dynamic imaging procedures to  track the development of grafted stem cells as they migrate through host cortex  and functionally integrate with host neural network. Migration of cells and  changes in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning  procedure with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across  sessions. Additionally,  continual imaging over a region will give us the ability to track the stem  cells along with their change in cellular activities upon transplantation in  which temporal and spatial information is simultaneously acquired. I will also  record the running behavior of the mice utilizing a ball treadmill on which the  mouse can run freely during the imaging sessions. Additionally, we can use  information theory to produce measurements of neural activity as it relates to  behavior. Specifically, mutual information (i.e. cross-correlation) between  network activity and behavior (movement) can be calculated in which the measure  indicates the functional integration of cells in the host neural network  presumably responsible for corresponding behavior. </div>
