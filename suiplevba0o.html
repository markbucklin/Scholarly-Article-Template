Additionally, continual imaging over a region will  give us the ability to track the stem cells along with their change in cellular  activities upon transplantation in which temporal and spatial information is  simultaneously acquired.         </div><div></div><div></div><div>Direct and continuous observation of grafted cells in  living animals is now feasible through imaging technologies using various  labeling strategies and imaging modalities. </div><div></div><div></div><div>Technical advances in tools available to visualize and manipulate dynamic cellular processes in real time have provided an unprecedented lens to interrogate the complex neural network.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Advances in digital imaging technology and synthetic proteins over the last decade have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for recording neural activity in vivo. Image sensors available in scientific cameras are larger, faster, and more sensitive compared to those previously available in science-grade cameras. Meanwhile, the iterative improvements of Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) allow to detect neural activation with increasingly high fidelity. The combination of developments enables the use of conventional epifluorescence microscopy techniques to visualize neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons in vivo at single-cell resolution. Increasing fraction of observable neurons within the larger context of multicellular networks may provide better insights into neural coding across wide areas of the brain.&nbsp;</div>
