These development have enabled to open a wider channel to the brain than previously possible and to simultaneously record the neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment. </div><div></div><div>Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells. <i>(behavior tracking)</i> </div><div></div><div></div><div>Optical imaging  combined with genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) has been used for  long-term repeated <i>in vivo</i> imaging in  the intact brain. The activity of neural populations can be measured by the  fluorescence change of GECIs due to the transient of cytoplasmic-free calcium  concentration triggered by action potentials. The iterative improvements of  GECIs allow the tool to image the neural activity <i>in vivo,</i> comparable to electrophysiology recording, to detect  action potentials (Tian et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2013; Thestrup et al.,  2014). Calcium imaging of stem cell grafts may be a powerful tool for a more  thorough assessment of their functional connection into the neural network,  through large-scale imaging of the population.</div>
