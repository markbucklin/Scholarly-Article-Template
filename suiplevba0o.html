This includes several classes of synthetic proteins used for labeling as well as sensing and modulating neural activity, such as Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) and a diverse assembly of opsins. This also includes optical imaging modalities including confocal microscopy, multi-photon microscopy and epifluorescence microscopy.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>High-resolution volume scanning using two-photon microscopy can elucidate three-dimensional morphology at cellular and subcellular levels of individual neurons and the interactions between in their native context.

This advances   in digital imaging technology, combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for functional imaging in vivo over the last decade. Using a conventional epifluorescence microscopy techniques with a scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) camera, we are able to record neural activity from&nbsp;hundreds to thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution. Increasing fraction of observable neurons  may provide better insights into neural coding     within the larger context of multicellular networks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div>                                  Migration of cells and changes  in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning procedure  with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across sessions. Additionally, continual imaging over a region will  give us the ability to track the stem cells along with their change in cellular  activities upon transplantation in which temporal and spatial information is  simultaneously acquired.         </div><div></div><div></div>
