<div>In this document, I  propose to develop an experimental platform that enables long-term optical  imaging of stem cells to understand their functional integration upon grafting  into an adult mouse brain. The ability to perform chronic imaging over the same  region will allow the migration of these cells to be traced along with any  changes in cellular activities over the maturation and integration period, with  spatio-temporal resolution. There has been no prior report of <i>in vivo</i> imaging of grafted stem cells  labeled with GECI in a behaving mouse, and the development of such tool will be  important to advance our understanding on how stem cells form a functional  network in the brain, and may contribute towards the development of stem cell  therapies in neurodegenerative disorders.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process,  </div>
