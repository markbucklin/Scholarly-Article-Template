The regenerative processes involve complex dynamics of cellular interactions, and donor cells must be able to survive, migrate to target sites, differentiate into specific neural phenotypes, and establish appropriate connectivity with host neural and synaptic networks. Conventional studies on the anatomical and the functional integration of transplanted cells commonly rely on immunohistochemical methods combined with rabies tracing and electron microscopy, and electrophysiological and optical recording, respectively. </div><div></div><div>Remarkably, grafted interneuron progenitor cells  have been reported to propagate from the original site, differentiate into  various mature interneurons, and integrate into neural circuits of the postnatal  and adult brains. After the transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice  electrophysiology have been performed on brain sections to quantify and  validate the survival, differentiation, migration, and integration of  MGE-derived interneurons. Previous studies in mice have reported that the  transplanted cells exhibit a survival rate of 20 % up to a year after  transplantation (Zipancic et al., 2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from the injection site in host cortical tissue,  and differentiate into mature interneurons with almost half of the population  expressing somatostatin and over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et  al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition,  whole-cell recordings of transplanted interneurons demonstrate spontaneous and  evoked current, suggesting that the cells make synaptic connections with host  neurons (Southwell et al., 2010).   &nbsp;</div><div></div><div>Much of the assessments, however, heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal samples from different cohorts of animals at distinct time points. Such experimental procedures are laborious, inefficient, and often time and resource consuming. The technical ability for continuous observation with high temporal and spatial resolution of transplanted cells would be important to elucidate the dynamic regenerative processes</div><div>derived a comprehensive understanding of the regenerative processes at all time points&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><h2 data-label="789092" class="ltx_title_subsection">Assessing stem cell function by continuous measurement of network activity</h2><ul><li>Progression of characteristic spontaneous activity: </li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>predictable synchronous bursts -&gt; unpredictable asynchronous&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>early eagerness to form synaptic connections to other neurons (over-connect),    then prune: how this relates to functional integration with host, and how this differs from normal development (in-situ) and isolated development (in-vitro)... </li><li>how differences in connection characteristics affects spontaneous neural activity</li></ul><ul><li>Characteristic synchronized burst activity patterns in cultured neuron</li></ul><div>Transplants can be tracked using a variety of methods, including periodic electrophysiology, ex-vivo imaging of tracer, immunohistochemistry and ...</div>
