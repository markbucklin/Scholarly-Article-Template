<div>Stem cells are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple specialized
</div><div>neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system. The
therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems
in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage. A number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies
for strokes and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients.
Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcomes remain highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint
which factors lead to failure or success. Meanwhile, the snake oil industry that purports 'miracle' stem cells offers high hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this early stage of development of the therapeutic
</div><div>strategies, and the presumed mechanisms responsible for graft-induced eects often remain poorly validated.
</div><div>A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation are of crucial
</div><div>importance to ensure the safety and ecacy of stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, there
</div><div>is currently no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process, not to
</div><div>mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div>
