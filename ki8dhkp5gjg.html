<div> We also report here an adaptation of the more thoroughly-tested  headplate and cranial window design described above. The most obvious  difference in the newer design is a substantially larger window, which provides  optical access to the entire dorsal cortex. Additional features were added to  aid window positioning, improve sealing performance, and to simplify  fabrication. Adding the additional design features was made possible by  switching the headplate fabrication process from CNC machining to 3D printing,  as discussed below. Following is a summary of the major changes incorporated in  the latest configuration, included here to demonstrate the adaptability of the  basic design described above.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The height and width of the window frame and chamber were  increased, and the window thickness decreased. Protrusions were added to the  bottom surface of the headplate which follow the lateral edges of the chamber.  These protrusions contact the mouse cranium along the squamosal suture to  maintain a rigid skull-to-headplate attachment despite a reduction in  attachment area and removal of a larger fraction of parietal and frontal bone.  A thin skirt was added to the bottom surface of the optical insert along its  perimeter to help block tissue growth across the imaging area. This is  analogous to the vertical-walled column of the prior design, which compensated  for the skull thickness, but it accommodates the irregular curves of the  endocranium surrounding the larger window. Window installation and height  adjustment are improved by fixing small nuts into the headplate on either side  of the chamber, and using fine-threaded screws to fasten the optical insert in  place. This method of window installation provides a vast improvement over the  dental cement method used with the prior design and facilitates fine  adjustments to the window height. A thin coat of silicone was added to the  chamber's inner walls prior to installation to help seal the upper rim of the  chamber with the outer edge of the optical insert. The tape that was used  previously to protect the top surface of the implant was replaced with a solid  flat magnetically-coupled cap.</div>
