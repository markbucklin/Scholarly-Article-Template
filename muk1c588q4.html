In primate cortical imaging,  transparent silicone dural substitute has been used to replace the excised dura  and installed in contact with the exposed tissue to protect from infection and  inflammation (Arieli et al., 2002). The dural substitute is made of poly-dimethylsiloxane  (PDMS) that is optically clear and maintains a good optical quality by  preventing tissue regrowth that would otherwise deteriorate the imaging  condition by clouding. Furthermore the material is biocompatible, makes tight  seal to maintain tissue homeostasis, and prevents cortical tissue from  inflammation. In addition to the optical properties of PDMS, I am interested in  exploring the possibility of designing the cranial window using this material  because it provides a softer and more flexible interface to the brain,  potentially causing less irritation as compared to the conventional approach of  using glass.</div><div>Overall, it is  essential to have flexible access to the brain tissue under the window, because  the goal of the project is to image stem cells after transplantation in  cortical tissue. Two criteria are of importance for the imaging system for this  project: (1) the system must provide access to brain under the window for stem  cell transplantation; (2) the cranial window should allow immediate imaging  after the transplantation as well as chronic imaging to capture the critical  period of integration and maturation of the transplanted cells. In this  section, I propose to develop a polymer-based optical imaging system allowing  flexible and repeated access to the brain tissue under the window while  maintaining the improved imaging quality over an extended period. </div>
