<div>Over the course of imaging across months, surface vasculature was utilized as landmarks to track the locations and the cellular dynamics of identical cells. The location of hundreds of cells were identified by consolidating both static and dynamic features of fluorescence intensity for each imaging session using an automatic computational algorithm. Once the cells were detected, we recorded the time-series of the pixel fluorescence intensity values enclosed within each cellular boundary which preserves the information at the subcellular level. The migratory activity of grafted cells was not fully captured in this experiment as the daily imaging duration of 5 minutes was insufficient relative to the first week during which the majority of migration take place (REF), and the imaging session started a few days into the engraftment as the fluorescence expression was hardly detectable beforehand. However, the post-migration cells were dispersed and sparsely located, and identical cells were easily distinguishable among imaging sessions by comparing the cellular map from each session. For instance, an average of XX % of identical cells on 15 DAT were identified in the cellular map of 250 DAT.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>(INCLUDE: Individual cell report -- Activation characteristic change; shape/intensity; firing rate; auto-correlation; kinetic - activation time, activation duration, amplitude, normal compared to cortical neurons? difference between the sources?)</div>
