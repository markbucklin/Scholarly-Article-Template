By  labeling stem cells with GECI, the imaging technique will allow a more thorough  assessment of the functional connectivity of the grafted cells in the brain,  whereas electrophysiology is restricted to measuring the connectivity of one or  two target regions. The utility of the platform will be  tested by performing periodic structural and dynamic imaging procedures to  track the development of grafted stem cells as they migrate through host cortex  and functionally integrate with host neural network. Migration of cells and  changes in morphology can be tracked using a high-resolution volume scanning  procedure with a two-photon microscope and single cell tracking across  sessions. Additionally,  continual imaging over a region will give us the ability to track the stem  cells along with their change in cellular activities upon transplantation in  which temporal and spatial information is simultaneously acquired. I will also  record the running behavior of the mice utilizing a ball treadmill on which the  mouse can run freely during the imaging sessions. Additionally, we can use  information theory to produce measurements of neural activity as it relates to  behavior. Specifically, mutual information (i.e. cross-correlation) between  network activity and behavior (movement) can be calculated in which the measure  indicates the functional integration of cells in the host neural network  presumably responsible for corresponding behavior. </div>
