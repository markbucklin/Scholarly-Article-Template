This dissertation covers the development of an experimental platform that enables optical imaging of stem&nbsp; cells and the observation of the evolution of neural activity pattern during integration gathered from a year-long course of wide-field imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp;For chronic optical imaging of stem cells, we require a&nbsp; system that (i) can be stably implanted prior to stem cell transplantation, at&nbsp; which time imaging must commence immediately to capture the early stages of&nbsp; integration (ii) allows access to the brain after initial implantation for the&nbsp; stem cell transplantation and (iii) maintains optical clarity throughout the&nbsp; study period and allows repeated access to brain surface for tissue regrowth&nbsp; removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wide-field epifluorescence imaging of a living&nbsp; brain has substantially expanded our ability to perform high-throughput&nbsp; detection of neural activity at a spatial and temporal resolution sufficient to&nbsp; capture rich cellular dynamics of large interconnected networks of neurons. Yet&nbsp; optical signals are highly sensitive to light scattering, and the preservation&nbsp; of optical clarity through craniotomies is critically important for&nbsp; high-resolution imaging. Longitudinal imaging in cortex, however, is often limited&nbsp; due to granulation tissue growth between the brain and the imaging access&nbsp; window, and its inhomogeneous structure induces a significant level of optical&nbsp; scattering, thus severely compromising spatial resolution.&nbsp;The&nbsp; process leading to functional integration of transplants with existing&nbsp; host neural circuitry is known to occur over a period of weeks to months, and this complex&nbsp; sequence of steps required to complete this integration has never been&nbsp; continuously observed and hence is not well characterized. To address this&nbsp; concern, I developed a polydimethylsiloxane-based cranial&nbsp; window system that can faithfully prevent the optically obstructive tissue from&nbsp; growing under the craniotomy. Additionally, the two-part system is constructed&nbsp; to allow for continued full tissue access after its initial installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the&nbsp; motor cortex, and imaged the neural activity of GECI-labeled transplants over the same region over several months, using a wide-field&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; epifluorescence&nbsp; microscope. I performed periodic imaging procedure to track the development of grafted stem cells as the migrate through host cortex and functionally integrate with host neural networks.&nbsp;The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics over the course of integration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Data from periodic imaging sessions can be analyzed to assess evolving patterns of neural co-activity, and associated&nbsp; changes in network information encoding.&nbsp;We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Additionally, we also explore the use of information theory to produce measurements of neural activity. Several examples of number of different approaches to measure neural activity of stem cells reported in this chapter reveal various aspects of the&nbsp;well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process. The use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy.&nbsp;The development of this imaging technique is important for a&nbsp; more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will&nbsp; ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurological disorders.how different sources have different courses</div>
