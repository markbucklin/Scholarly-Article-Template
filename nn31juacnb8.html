<div>The therapeutic potential of stem cells,  due to their ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cell types and  capacity for limitless expansion, makes them a promising vehicle for repairing  and replacing damaged cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Preliminary clinical  trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease report that  transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. In this thesis proposal, I outline an  experimental platform which I am developing to enable optical imaging of stem  cells and facilitate a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. I have recently developed  a polymer-based optical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.  Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neuronal activity of the progenitor cell-derived  neurons at the same region over several weeks, using a wide-field epifluorescence  microscope. Additionally, the local cells in the recipient mouse brain could be  labeled with a distinguishable fluorescent activity indicator, and moving  forward I plan to monitor the interplay between the two populations to  understand the functional integration of the progenitor cells into the host  neural network. The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.</div>
