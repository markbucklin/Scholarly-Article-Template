<div>The therapeutic potential of stem cells,  due to their ability to differentiate into multiple specialized cell types and  capacity for limitless expansion, makes them a promising vehicle for repairing  and replacing damaged cells in neurodegenerative diseases. Preliminary clinical  trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinsonâ€™s disease report that  transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, stem  cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are still at an early stage of  development, and a better understanding of how to induce functional integration  of stem cell-derived neurons is essential for clinical translation. However,  only a limited number of tools are available to observe grafted stem cells and  to monitor their development process. In this thesis proposal, I outline an  experimental platform which I am developing to enable optical imaging of stem  cells and facilitate a more detailed understanding of their functional  integration upon grafting into the adult mouse brain. I have recently developed  a polymer-based op </div><div>tical imaging implant that allows tissue access for stem cell  transplantation and maintains optical clarity throughout the study period.  Utilizing the system, I have grafted interneuron progenitor cells into the  motor cortex, and imaged the neuronal activity of the progenitor cell-derived  neurons at the same region over several weeks, using a wide-field epifluorescence  microscope. Additionally, the local cells in the recipient mouse brain could be  labeled with a distinguishable fluorescent activity indicator, and moving  forward I plan to monitor the interplay between the two populations to  understand the functional integration of the progenitor cells into the host  neural network. The development of this imaging technique is important for a  more thorough assessment of stem cell engraftment in the brain and will  ultimately help advance stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative disorders.</div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span class="au-background-blue" data-background="true">Chapter 1: Introduction</span></b></div><div></div><h1 data-label="286720" class="ltx_title_section">Promise and challenges in stem cell therapy for neurological diseases</h1><div>Stem cells are immature cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate into multiple specialized neural phenotypes and can be used to replace lost or damaged neurons in the central nervous system.&nbsp;The therapeutic potential of stem cells holds great promises by the direct action on underlying cause of problems in neurological diseases characterized by cell loss or damage. Number of clinical trials of stem cell therapies in stroke and Parkinson's disease report that transplantation can lead to symptomatic relief in patients. Nevertheless, improvements in patient outcome remain highly variable, and it is challenging to pinpoint what factors lead to failure or success. Meanwhile, snake oil industry (e.g. 'miracle' stem cell) offers high-hopes and breeds confusion and distrust at this early stage of development      of the therapeutic strategies, and the presumed mechanisms responsible for graft-induced effects often remains poorly validated. A better understanding and control of the regenerative processes subsequent to transplantation are of crucial importance to resolve safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies for clinical applications. However, currently, there is no easy way to observe grafted stem cells and to monitor their developmental process, not to mention whether they even survive in host tissue, crippling any attempt to develop more reliable procedures.</div><div></div><div></div><h1 data-label="817913" class="ltx_title_section">Background in neurological stem cell research</h1><h2 data-label="480719" class="ltx_title_subsection">Embryonic development of neurons in the mouse</h2><ul><li>text book basics of neural development</li><li>where the stem cells develop (MGE, LGE) and where they migrate (cortex) to become what they become (inhibitory and excitatory pyramidal...), and on what timeline</li></ul><blockquote><ul><li>MGE vs cortical: different disease specific applications. e.g. inhibitory cells for epilepsy... dopaminargic cells for PD,&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><ul><li>When on this timeline they are harvested</li><li>what is the source of the cells</li><li>Where and how they are transplanted</li></ul><div>                                  Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div>These features of  cortical interneuron transplantation make it an attractive therapeutic approach  to repair neurodegenerati ve disorders associated with cortical interneuron  dysfunction. For instance, epilepsy is caused by the impaired balance between  excitatory and inhibitory neural activity where suppressed GABA-mediated  inhibition is the known mechanism of the pathology (Tyson and Anderson, 2014;  Hunt and Baraban, 2015). Consistent with the previous findings, the grafted MGE  cells integrated and developed into mature interneurons in epileptic brain, and  increased the frequency and amplitudes of postsynaptic currents on pyramidal  cells (Hunt et al., 2013; Zipancic et al., 2010). Furthermore, noted reduction  in the occurrence of epilepsy and post-seizure mortality was reported in these  studies. Nevertheless, current techniques including brain sectioning and  behavioral quantification do not provide the ability to track the fate of stem  cells <i>in vivo</i> as the cells migrate,  mature and integrate upon transplantation. </div>
