<div>&nbsp;We periodically examined the imaging chamber condition in  all implanted mice using a stereoscopic microscope. Degradation of the optical  interface was found frequently in prototypes/procedures that preceded the one  mentioned here. This was observed as progressive extension of a cloudy white  inhomogeneous layer across the brain-facing surface of the optical insert.  Using the design and procedures reported in this paper, this type of  degradation rarely occurred, limited to the cases reported above in Batch 1.</div><div>Remarkably, but not unexpectedly, tissue growth surrounding  the insert was evident in all cases, regardless of window quality. The tissue  appeared highly vascularized, and grew from the craniotomy edge outward along  the chamber floor (figure 3-c). This growth is a natural response to the tissue  damage inflicted by any craniotomy procedure. The difference observed here is  only that the growth does not extend under the window. Instead, it forms a  non-adhesive interface with the vertical-walled columns and diverges upward  into the aseptic chamber, replacing the agarose fill between the optical insert  and the adhesive cement covering the skull and chamber floor. To further  investigate the structure of granulation tissue growth into the peripheral  chamber areas we removed the optical insert for unobstructed observation in  several mice. An especially gnarly example from a 6-month duration window is  pictured in figure 3-d. </div>
