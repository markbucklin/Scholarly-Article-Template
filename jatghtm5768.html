<div>Recording neural activity using optical techniques has been performed for many years but has become increasingly popular recently owing to the technical advancement of larger, faster, and more sensitive imaging sensors combined with new generations of Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicators (GECI) that can report neural activity with extremely high fidelity. These development have enabled to open a wider channel to the brain than previously possible and to simultaneously record the neural activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons. As the general principles of brain function lies upon the communication of input sensory through interconnected neurons, the technique has been proven effective to study the brain by observing neural activity of collections of neurons and measuring their responses to variable conditions of the external environment. Likewise, in order to achieve effective cell treatment therapy, grafted cells must establish functional connections with host neural circuits and be able to propagate input through the interconnections of which can be measured by recording their neural activity through such technique following the transplantation. Furthermore, long-term observation of network activity and its quantifiable changes could be used as a measure to reflect the network developmental process of stem cells within host brain what was previously unavailable from snapshots of population of cells. <i>(behavior tracking)</i> </div><div></div><h1 data-label="488593" class="ltx_title_section">Imaging Calcium dynamics in behaving mouse</h1><div>In this paper, we demonstrate the use of wide-field fluorescence imaging to monitor the process of functional integration of neural progenitor cells grafted into adult neocortex. The neural activity of GECI-labeled cells was captured in awake behaving mouse with high spatial and temporal resolution and was tracked from the same region across several months, including a case that extended over a year. The serial imaging sessions revealed gradual transition of neural activity within the large interconnected network with distinctive firing patterns of synchronized and randomized dynamics. We also report a novel measure to functional integration of grafted stem cells that was derived from tracking the change in information carrying capacity within the network during the integration process. Here, we demonstrate a single approach using fluorescence imaging to describe the well-coordinated sequence of events comprising the regenerative process, but the use of such technology can be expanded for a variety of applications to reveal novel aspects of the process that can greatly accelerate our insights to develop an effective cell-based therapy. </div>
