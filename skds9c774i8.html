<div>The first batch served as a short trial-run for the  prototype and procedures whose performance in early tests suggested strong  potential for long-term reliability. We ran the first batch for 4-6 weeks to  get a better assessment of what we could expect for long-term viability. With  this design and minor modifications to the surgical procedure, we felt  comfortable using the window in longitudinal studies with significant  investment of time and resources at stake that would also allow for continuous  assessment of the windowâ€™s optical performance in parallel. The first batch (N  = 7) of windows was installed and was evaluated 2-3 times/week for just over 1  month. Several more were installed for use in a long-term imaging study  beginning with the second batch (N = 6), then the last batch (N = 5). The  results of these runs are reported below, summarized in figure 3-b. </div>
