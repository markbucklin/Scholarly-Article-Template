<div>F</div><div>The technique  provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and  functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and  microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method  is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the  population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. </div><div></div><div>Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent  proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of  regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence  of events.         </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
