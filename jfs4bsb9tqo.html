<div></div><div>For instance, the dynamic sequence  of migration and morphological development of grafted stem cells have been  followed over extended period using magnetic resonance imaging in animals and  humans.         </div><div>                                  A recent report demonstrated longitudinal observation  of the dynamics of morphological integration and synaptic reinnervation of  grafted stem cells using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. The technique  provides high temporal resolution and can reveal detailed structural and  functional dynamics within live tissues at the single-cell level, and  microscopes are comparatively inexpensive and widely available. Yet the method  is limited to small fields-of-view and is insufficient to capture the  population of grafted stem cells while many are highly migratory. </div><div></div><div>Other  fluorescence imaging approaches may be able to surmount the limitation, but  their use have thus far been limited. Additionally, utilizing novel fluorescent  proteins may expand the technical ability to capture different aspects of  regenerative process that could not be revealed previously from static sequence  of events.         </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>
