This advances   in digital imaging technology, combined with the latest generation of GECIs have greatly contributed to new optical techniques for functional imaging in vivo over the last decade. Using a conventional epifluorescence microscopy techniques with a scientific-CMOS (sCMOS) camera, we are able to record neural activity from&nbsp;hundreds to thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution. Increasing fraction of observable neurons  may provide better insights into neural coding     within the larger context of multicellular networks.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div>                                          </div><div></div><div></div>
