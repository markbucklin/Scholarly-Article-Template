This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div></div><div> </div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Overall, it is  essential to have flexible access to the brain tissue under the window, because  the goal of the project is to image stem cells after transplantation in  cortical tissue. Two criteria are of importance for the imaging system for this  project: (1) the system must provide access to brain under the window for stem  cell transplantation; (2) the cranial window should allow immediate imaging  after the transplantation as well as chronic imaging to capture the critical  period of integration and maturation of the transplanted cells. In this  section, I propose to develop a polymer-based optical imaging system allowing  flexible and repeated access to the brain tissue under the window while  maintaining the improved imaging quality over an extended period. </div>
