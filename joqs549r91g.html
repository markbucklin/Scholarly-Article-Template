This ability relies heavily on maintaining a clear optical light-path by forming a stable non-scattering optical interface with neural tissue  overlying the targeted brain region. </div><div></div><div>Attempts to image neocortical regions on  the surface of mouse brain typically use a small glass disc attached to the  cranial surface to seal and protect the craniotomy. This  approach, however, is often challenged by progressive deterioration in optical  quality. The degradation is observed as a cloudy layer that gradually overtake  the fluid filled gap between the cranial window and the brain tissue, and is  thought to arise from the natural inflammatory response that follows a  craniotomy. As granulation tissue grows, its inhomogeneous  structure scatters light at the brain-to-window interface, which consequently  degrades optical quality and blurs fluorescence signals.</div><div></div><div></div><div> However, once the cover  glass is installed, it is difficult to access the brain underlying the window  to inject virus or to deliver drugs or chemicals for any cellular manipulation.  </div><div></div><div>Thus, cranial  windows with modified designs have been reported that allow repeated injection  of substances into the brain tissue. Recently, a cranial window with an  infusion cannula fixed adjacent to a cover glass has been reported permitting repeated  injections while simultaneously imaging the brain (Zuluaga-Ramirez et al.,  2015). However, this technique is limited to injecting through a cannula that  is placed at one end of the cover glass, resulting in a gradient of the  substance through the brain and an unequal effect within the imaging area.  Another method which has been reported is a cranial window with a drilled hole  sealed with biocompatible polymer, which allows access to the brain and  self-seals after retraction of the pipette (Roome and Kuhn, 2014). Despite the  simple and easy design of the polymer plug, it has been noted that the dura  regrowth under the plug impedes access for injections over time. Lastly, a  removable cranial window has been described that permits viral injection and durotomy  or bone growth removal allowing extended imaging period with enhanced clarity  (Goldey et al., 2014). Nonetheless, the procedure for window removal and  replacement is inconvenient as the dental cement holding the window to the  skull needs to be drilled away and the installation of a new window needs to be  repeated.</div><div></div><div>While cover glasses  have been extensively used as cranial windows for <i>in vivo</i> imaging in mice, the use of an alternative material for the  window, such as polymer, has yet to be explored. In primate cortical imaging,  transparent silicone dural substitute has been used to replace the excised dura  and installed in contact with the exposed tissue to protect from infection and  inflammation (Arieli et al., 2002). The dural substitute is made of poly-dimethylsiloxane  (PDMS) that is optically clear and maintains a good optical quality by  preventing tissue regrowth that would otherwise deteriorate the imaging  condition by clouding. Furthermore the material is biocompatible, makes tight  seal to maintain tissue homeostasis, and prevents cortical tissue from  inflammation. In addition to the optical properties of PDMS, I am interested in  exploring the possibility of designing the cranial window using this material  because it provides a softer and more flexible interface to the brain,  potentially causing less irritation as compared to the conventional approach of  using glass.</div><div></div><div>Overall, it is  essential to have flexible access to the brain tissue under the window, because  the goal of the project is to image stem cells after transplantation in  cortical tissue. Two criteria are of importance for the imaging system for this  project: (1) the system must provide access to brain under the window for stem  cell transplantation; (2) the cranial window should allow immediate imaging  after the transplantation as well as chronic imaging to capture the critical  period of integration and maturation of the transplanted cells. In this  section, I propose to develop a polymer-based optical imaging system allowing  flexible and repeated access to the brain tissue under the window while  maintaining the improved imaging quality over an extended period. </div>
