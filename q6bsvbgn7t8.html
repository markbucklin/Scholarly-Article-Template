This capability offers a number of advantages. It may  save time and resources -- particularly during the prototype stages -- by  allowing time to ensure each implanted mouse fully recovers from the initial  procedure. Additionally, the delay between surgeries allows the heightened  inflammation and other immune system response triggered by craniotomy to  normalize before attempting a tissue intervention that is sensitive to these  conditions (e.g. viral or cell injections) (ref). Through this mechanism the  system offers the capability to image the first tissue intervention from day 0.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Similarly, designing the system to be installable in  multiple stages enables trivial and repeatable tissue access at later time  points by simple reversal of procedure for optical insert installation. The  process may be comparable to a previously reported method of removing the  entire glass window to access the tissue (ref). With this system, however, the  methods used to remove and replace are faster and simpler and carry less risk  of tissue damage compared. Additionally, the described methods of facilitating  tissue access can be advantageous over a fixed access port by providing full  access without compromising the image field (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="415096" class="ltx_title_subsection">Design Adaptation</h2><div>While the specific designs described in this report have  much to offer, the greatest asset of the underlying system is its easy  adaptability. The design can be rapidly transformed to accommodate various  applications or to modify its performance in response to new technologies and  demands. This rapid adaptability was a primary goal of this project, and  informed our design and engineering decisions throughout development. Anyone  with access to common laboratory equipment and moderate engineering and  fabrication skills can produce a system to fit their particular needs. As an inherent  aspect of any design process, the adaptation of the original design evolved  over the course of prototyping and testing. In presenting two designs in this  report, our intention was to demonstrate the technical feasibility of  continuous development of a future-proof system. The original system was  adapted to accommodate the continuous evolution of image sensor technology,  particularly the growth in size and resolution, expanding the field of view and  allowing simultaneous access to cellular interactions across multiple brain  regions using wide-field imaging (ref).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The iterative process used here was only made possible by  using the now widely available rapid prototyping procedures, 3D-printing and  laser-cutting -- major progress of manufacturing and its increased versatility,  providing better quality, customization, lower cost and shorter production time  (ref). In an effort to compare various manufacturing technologies, we explored  manufacturing the finalized product design through a number of companies and  advanced with 3D metal printing with overall satisfaction at i.materialise --  we had also developed the parts through other rapid prototyping companies  including Shapeways and Sculpteo.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="322223" class="ltx_title_subsection">Future Improvements</h2><div>&nbsp;</div><h2 data-label="147941" class="ltx_title_subsection">Conclusion</h2><div></div><div></div>
