<div>&nbsp;Configuring the implant as described, so as to enable a  staged installation of multiple parts enables surgical procedures to be spread  across multiple days. This capability offers a number of advantages. It may  save time and resources -- particularly during the prototype stages -- by  allowing time to ensure each implanted mouse fully recovers from the initial  procedure. Additionally, the delay between surgeries allows the heightened  inflammation and other immune system response triggered by craniotomy to  normalize before attempting a tissue intervention that is sensitive to these  conditions (e.g. viral or cell injections) (ref). Through this mechanism the  system offers the capability to image the first tissue intervention from day 0.</div><div>&nbsp;Similarly, designing the system to be installable in  multiple stages enables trivial and repeatable tissue access at later time  points by simple reversal of procedure for optical insert installation. The  process may be comparable to a previously reported method of removing the  entire glass window to access the tissue (ref). With this system, however, the  methods used to remove and replace are faster and simpler and carry less risk  of tissue damage compared. Additionally, the described methods of facilitating  tissue access can be advantageous over a fixed access port by providing full  access without compromising the image field (ref).</div>
