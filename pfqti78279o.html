<div></div><div>    Either way, however, the assessments heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal samples and different cohorts of animals at distinct time points need to be screened. Such experimental procedures are laborious and often time and resource consuming.&nbsp;    In order to develop stem cell-based therapeutics that would lead to  functional restoration in the brain, the technical ability for continuous  observation with high temporal and spatial resolution would be important for  comprehensive understanding of the biological processes.        </div><div></div>
