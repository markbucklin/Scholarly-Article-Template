<div>     After the transplantation, immunohistochemistry and slice  electrophysiology have been performed on brain sections to quantify and  validate the survival, differentiation, migration, and integration of  MGE-derived interneurons. Previous studies in mice have reported that the  transplanted cells exhibit a survival rate of 20 % up to a year after  transplantation (Zipancic et al., 2010; Hunt et al., 2012; Alvarex-Dolado et  al., 2006), migrate up to 3 mm from the injection site in host cortical tissue,  and differentiate into mature interneurons with almost half of the population  expressing somatostatin and over one-quarter expressing parvalbumin (Sebe et  al., 2014; Alvarex-Dolado et al., 2006; Southwell et al., 2010). In addition,  whole-cell recordings of transplanted interneurons demonstrate spontaneous and  evoked current, suggesting that the cells make synaptic connections with host  neurons (Southwell et al., 2010).    </div><div></div><div></div><div>Most inhibitory interneuron in cerebral cortex originate in  progenitor domains of central telencephalon including caudal and medial  ganglionic eminences (MGE) (Southwell et al., 2014), and several <i>in vivo</i> transplantations have been  performed by collecting the progenitor cells from the regions of E13.5 mouse  embryos.</div><div></div><div>    Either way, however, the assessments heavily depend on temporally static analyses of terminal samples and different cohorts of animals at distinct time points need to be screened. Such experimental procedures are laborious and often time and resource consuming.&nbsp;    In order to develop stem cell-based therapeutics that would lead to  functional restoration in the brain, the technical ability for continuous  observation with high temporal and spatial resolution would be important for  comprehensive understanding of the biological processes.        </div><div></div>
