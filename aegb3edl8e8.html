<div> The dental cement<a> </a><a href="#_msocom_6">[SC6]</a>&nbsp;connecting the window and headplate was etched away using a dental  drill. Before removing the window, we thoroughly flushed debris from the  surrounding surfaces with sterile saline. <a>Replacement windows were installed using the  same procedures described above for initial attachment. Localizing the  replacement window to the same position was aided by the expansion of  granulation tissue up to the walls of the prior window.</a><a href="#_msocom_7">[SC7]</a>&nbsp; </div>
